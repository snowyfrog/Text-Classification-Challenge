0	0	a	"I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable."
1	1	a	"This is a very nice top, however, it was too large for me. i ordered a medium and needed a small. i am 5'9"",145 lbs.i will try again with a small."
2	1	a	I was looking for a basic black one piece suit that sucked in the tummy, but with style and a little flair. this is it! the ruching is perfect, the material is great and the separation of the straps at the top give it more style. i am usually a size 6, but ordered an 8 because i have a 34d chest. i was right on. the 8 covers the top with a small amount of cleavage and the bottom still fits because the ruching is a little tighter in the waist. i plan to wear this to the local pools this summer an
3	1	a	Very cute, easy to wear, and looks professional! great for work or a weekend. love this top!
4	0	a	When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?
5	0	a	I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately, i will be returning this item.
6	1	a	I bought this is the orange/red motif and it is a beautiful print, although in person it is a more rich reddish color than the washed out model image. the entire shirt is sheer, so i will need to wear something under, but that does not bother me. i have a small chest (34a) and find that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back, but that would not be an issue if i was a little better endowed. this looks gorgeous with black pants and a blazer. not sure that it is worth full price, b
7	1	a	"This vest is perfect. it is a great layering piece to be worn with jeans, slacks or a skirt. it has a substantial weight without being restrictive. i made the purchase based on the other positive reviews and it was ""love at first sight."""
8	1	a	This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.
9	0	a	"I ca not believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just is not there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick, in fact it is quite sheer for ""velvet"". i honestly would not feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a, xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w"
10	1	a	Love the natural fabric blend and the natural style, also the unique color of the taupe. i am a size 4 to 6, and the small fit great. if you prefer a more fitted look, could probably size down.
11	1	a	These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.i loved the higher rise because they do not feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.love the braided styling around the pockets.the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.
12	1	a	"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands."
13	1	a	Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.
14	1	a	I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however, the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it is not that obvious in the photos, but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me, and it was too expensive to keep something that unflattering. too bad, if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
15	0	a	It the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.
16	1	a	I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it is not too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i have not had any problems with snagging
17	1	a	Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small.
18	1	a	This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.
19	1	a	This is a good basic casual skirt, and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts, but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8, which fit well. i will say it definitely a little snug though, even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy, and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.
20	1	a	This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up, i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however, the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice, additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves. i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n
21	1	a	"I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though, because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that was not the case this time around. i'm 5'4"" 130-135lbs, depending on my appetite!"
22	1	a	"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said, i think this top fits really well, and is very flattering. i also do not find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small, and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest, and i'm a 34d. (5'4"", 124 lbs, 36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue, however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po"
23	0	a	I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i do not even know if sizing up will mak
24	1	a	I love the design of this shirt - very flattering fit. very soft and great as a layering piece.
25	1	a	"I am a 5'10"" size 4 (or 28 long - i need a 33-34"" inseam) woman. i bought the s/m and they fit perfectly (with all the excess length bunching at my ankles, as designed)! i'm thrilled. i bought the light color. one thing, wear nude underwear and lighter (or just short) socks - these are definitely see-through! however, i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways - something always reaching down to my upper thighs, at least. so comfy and cozy!"
26	1	a	I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver
27	1	a	Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
28	1	a	"I absolutely loved the look of this top and had to try it on, so i ordered it in xs and s because i own a few other tylho shirts and know they can run large. when they arrived, i could tell with just one look how huge this top runs. i did not even bother opening the s. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 135lb, 32c, and the xs is slightly too big through my bust. it barely snug underneath my arms and not at all fitted down the sides of my ribcage, but i'm okay with that since it allows more room to wea"
29	1	a	Received this dress yesterday, love it!my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept..but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring.delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green.it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead.this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i
30	1	a	I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.
31	1	a	I used to walk by this dress, thinking not much of it. but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for. tried it on. fell in love. tried on the 4 and 6 - went with the 4, runs tts. if the dress is too large, the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress. somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette. with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels, my valentine date fell for this dress too. he said it r
32	1	a	This top has great lines and has a very flattering fit.
33	1	a	Love this top!! fits perfectly & it lovely
34	0	a	From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i did not feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it did not work out.
35	0	a	They are beautiful in person, until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist, roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather, especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams, is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
36	1	a	When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it spectacular. really beautiful.
37	1	a	I love, love this wide leg pants! they feel beautiful on and fit like a glove. i do think they run a bit small in the waist, because they were a bit too tight in my regular size. typically, cloths are a little too large in the waist on me (i have a curvy/athletic figure). as other reviewers stated, they pants are long, but they are great length for wedges. otherwise, i would recommend having the length tailored.
38	1	a	This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it was not particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.
39	1	a	This dress is everything i wanted it to be. i bought it to wear to a winter wedding and the material is perfect for that! i initially ordered it in a 0 regular and ended up having to exchange it for a 0 petite and it fits absolutely perfectly! the detailing on the shoulder is beautiful.
40	1	a	"This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7"", and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s, though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m"
41	1	a	I love this design so much and it is very well made. i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups. i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit. only con is that it seems to run small.
42	1	a	This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.
43	1	a	"We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable, yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as ""south-of-france"". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress, but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!"
44	0	a	I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering. the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made. however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
45	1	a	"Love, love, love but alas had to return. gorgeous fabric and elegant design, i purchased for an evening summer wedding. however, the cut of this dress is more suited to a small bust line and a short waist. i felt like it hit at my rib cage and not my natural waist and my top half was spilling out of the neckline. it was slightly loose so i do not think sizing up would have helped. maybe i needed to size down? i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs and had the 10. loved but it did not fit me properly. also noticed the"
46	1	a	These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.
47	1	a	Love this top, i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.
48	1	a	I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly was not see through. i would not go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no
49	1	a	I bought this top for work but i can also wear it out with friends. it is made well and has a lining that is comfortable and makes it flow nicely. it will be nice for summer. you can tie the neck or just leave the ties down so it has options.
50	1	a	I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.
51	1	a	I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then did not due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,
52	1	a	The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)
53	1	a	This sweater is gorgeous. it is soft and i love the button detail down the sides of the sleeves. i would have loved the blue color but it was sold out, so i settled for the soft peach color. it is a very pretty sweater and looks nice on.
54	1	a	This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale, so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size, what can i say its a simple top, well made and so soft.
55	1	a	Love these jeans! flattering and comfortable!! great length for short girl!! worth the money!
56	1	a	This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans, or, dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i was not sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big, but it does not have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!
57	1	a	This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.
58	0	a	"The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just was not working for me. i'm 5'8"" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just was not complimentary on me. this will have to go back."
59	1	a	"I do not normally like ""lace-up"" details, but for some reason, i do not mind it on this top. it a bit shorter than it looks on the model (and i'm not especially tall). the fabric is nice - not too heavy, not too lightweight. great for fall."
60	1	a	Bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing, but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable. it runs true to size. my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve, but because there was an extra it was easily fixed. definitely recommend!
61	1	a	This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.
62	1	a	I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.
63	1	a	I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.
64	1	a	Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.
65	1	a	Tried this on yesterday in the fitting room and i really wanted to get it but two problems - 1. not made for c cup bra women or larger and 2. the ruffles come right out of the nipple line area of the chest, so when you see yourself at a profile view, there these ruffles that look like they're coming out of your chest. just sayin'. not for me.
66	1	a	This top is way more sparkly and festive in person. i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party, but it would also go great with dark jeans. it is super cute, ca not wait to wear it.
67	1	a	Maybe the softest sweater that i own. buy it, and you wo not regret it!
68	1	a	Great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand. the chest and arm area is small. otherwise this top is great. just plan to size up one or two sizes. length was nice. hit right at the waist.
69	1	a	I was walking to the fitting room and i saw two of this dress on a rack- an xs and small. i could tell by looking at it that it runs small, so i grabbed a small to try on. i did not want to love this dress (it expensive), but i did. it is so pretty and flattering. i wish it were an inch or two longer, but it ok. with tights in the fall will be fine. not sure i would wear this to work, as i am a teacher and it is too short for me. it definitely runs small. i am between a 2 and a 4, so i took t
70	1	a	"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i ca not wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!"
71	1	a	I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email, i new i had to check it out. the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this was not a deal breaker for me. because of the boxy shape, i went with a s. i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish. i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fall/winter. in fact, i am wearing it right now!
72	0	a	I loved the fit, color and style, but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.
73	1	a	Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights
74	1	a	I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!
75	1	a	I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.
76	1	a	"I got these in the neutral color & quickly understood why they're categorized as ""loungewear"". if you're going to wear them out of the house, wear a tunic or a dress over them. i folded the scrunch part up over my calves & wore them like boot socks when i went out. i got a m/l & they fit about on par with other leggings / tights of that size range.when i got home, i rolled them down & put the bottoms over my heels. the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles. i recommend them for around"
77	1	a	This top is really comfortable, and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming, but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well, but it fine. the material is a nice light weight, but the pleats do fold up a little after washing, so ironing is required.
78	1	a	When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser
79	1	a	Like the other reviewers have said, this is a wider shirt, but the width done is in a stylish way. i did not think it looked frumpy or sack-like on. however, i found it to be rather short. i bought a 0 regular (not petite), and it fits shorter than many shirts i have from retailer, madewell, etc. which have the same looser fit. i am 5'2, 115 lbs., so it is odd that it fit somewhat short on me...if you are tall, it might bare your midriff some. i bought the peach, which was close to the color pictu
80	1	a	I am absolutely in love with this piece! yes it runs large. i'm usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly! the quality is superb. i love the feel of the faux fur, i want to pet it! and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever. thank you tracy!
81	1	a	Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u ca not tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in
82	1	a	Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.
83	1	a	"Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence. the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing. fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down. i had no weird sagging, bagging or poofiness. and i love the macrame belt! i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too. i purchased the small petite. my stats for fit reference: 5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide rib cage, size m/l tops, size s/m"
84	1	a	I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.
85	1	a	What?! i ca not believe this got so many mixed reviews! i was not sure what to expect and now that i've received it, i think it absolutely perfect. it flattering, the length is great, it tts, and the color is beautiful. i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either. i'm really pleased with this purchase and i ca not wait to wear it.
86	1	a	I really liked this dress. it so comfy, i could sleep in it plus it quite flattering. however, if you have a tummy, which i do, you have to really suck it in. the dress will show bulges but the layers make it a little more forgiving that the typical fitted dress. the length is great and conservative enough that i wore it to work today, though it does ride up as you walk. the blue is dark enough it could almost be worn with black shoes, almost. the top is really cut well with the perfect neck
87	1	a	The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately, this did not work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just does not work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous, which is never a good feeling. i recommend, but only for tall, slim types with a small bust.
88	1	a	I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!
89	1	a	These jeans are perfect in every way. the rise is perfect, the stretch is perfect. we need more washes in this exact fit. i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style!
90	1	a	The colors are beautiful
91	1	a	"I ordered the ""red"" in a size xl. the fit is perfect--it matches the model photos. the material is so soft. it definitely a cozy fabric. the red color description is wrong but the photo accurately shows how it really an orange shade. the color is cheery since it bright. it will be great to use on cold days."
92	1	a	The colors on this sweater are cute, the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts.
93	1	a	This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that why i gave it 4 stars for design.
94	1	a	This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground, i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats, this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just does not look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.
95	1	a	"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!"
96	1	a	Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.
97	1	a	I bought an extra small and i love it (i'm a size 2-4). it warm, it comfortable, it fits with everything, can be dressed up or down, it not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coat...it feels like you have a new friend...
98	1	a	"Bought this in xs petite - i'm 5'2"", 102, it was too big, so took it to a tailor. altered it so that horizontal stitching at the bottom sits gently on my hips, rather than floating way out all around. it now nice and flattering; i get tons of compliments. note that the fabric is more off white, than bright white; i bought it online thinking it would look good with white jeans - it actually looks best with blue jeans or navy shorts/pants. drapes nicely and does not wrinkle. a win!"
99	1	a	"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer."
100	1	a	I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful. i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
101	1	a	"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me, i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10."
102	1	a	Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!
103	1	a	Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.
104	1	a	These are absolutely fantastic! i love them!i stopped wearing pants about 4 years ago. i could never find any that would fit over my thighs/hips that were not too loose on my waist. took a chance with these after looking at the measurements and they fit perfect. higher waist than i'm used (sits just above my natural waistline) to with any of my skirts, but i'll get used to it. they're also too long to wear with any flats. being that i bought them for winter, i'll be perfectly fine with heeled bo
105	1	a	Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.
106	1	a	I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem is not flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
107	1	a	"This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner, to a wedding our just to feel special on"
108	1	a	This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!
109	1	a	"I loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long. at 5""3 i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time. this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either."
110	0	a	This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.
111	1	a	This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace, embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit, because i would like to button the sh
112	1	a	"I love this dress, but i am 5'7"" and a size 12, so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom, but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however, if he would make that ""skirt"" as a stand alone, i would buy in a second."
113	1	a	Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i do not think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they do not fit my body type
114	1	a	"Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference, i'm 5'4"", short-waisted with larger athletic thighs, smaller waist, bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i did not have to cut off several inches in length, though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag, but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the"
115	1	a	T.la makes the best tees. soft feel, sophisticated color layering, and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile, too. other tees fade, stretch out, shrink. not t.la. a gem.
116	1	a	I like the make of this dress, the fabric is thick and light at the same time.the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy. i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but did not gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so do not expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee
117	1	a	Cute shirt, it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!
118	1	a	I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation, and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.retailer has continually helped me present polished & professional, yet still show my personal style & inclusive nature.it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has
119	1	a	"So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a ""generous"" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the"
120	1	a	I wish summer was longer so i could have the opportunity to wear this more. much more eye-catching and unique in person than the photo. 5 stars.
121	1	a	In the on-line picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it. when it arrived, i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt! it was equally comfortable on. the rayon, tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel, that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing week-end or evening. i ordered the size 3 even though i usually order a small in most tops. this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look, and i was right about t
122	1	a	Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i did not feel like we could wear it all year round. ca not petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)
123	1	a	I have a number of mother denim items (jeans, skirts, etc) in a variety of sizes and, unfortunately, i find mother sizing very inconsistent. this skirt is no exception! it is, as expected, high quality: primarily cotton with a fair amount of stretch; very soft; frayed at both the hem and the waistband; and, it runs a little small, i have another mother pencil skirt in a size smaller that is actually wider than this skirt; still not sure if i'lll keep it.
124	1	a	The cut of this dress is designed for any figure! the back hem sweeps as you walk, and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay, such as bulges. even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress. only downside, if any, is the lavender coloring which does not do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair. i'm blonde, and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress, even i can see it does not say wow because i kind of fade away
125	1	a	Retailer sizes are all over the place. i fell in love with this top, and tried it a couple of times to see if it would work. unfortunately i have to send it back. the design and colors are very good. the side slits are very high, right up to the waist, but the top still looks good. unfortunately it is very small. it still fits because of the long side slits, and is not that tight at the top due to sleeveless, but the fit just was not as flattering. it does seem to run 1-2 sizes small, so i a
126	1	a	I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy. still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.
127	1	a	Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.
128	1	a	"When i was finally able to find my size available online, i did not hesitate. i am 5'4"", 123lbs, 34d and size 27 jeans. i originally ordered a small...wow! was i surprised it was too small, and cropped. i returned and ordered a medium, received today...and i have to say, i was super happy. it fit perfect, in fact it fit much like how the model fit in the photographs."
129	1	a	I bought the xs and the fit was good. i'll probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole, which is fine, but i prefer it closed. also i'll add a belt to cinch my waist, booties and maybe a hat.
130	1	a	This is a great sweater. i gave it four instead of five stars because it runs unusually wide and is a bit boxy. if you like your clothes a little big, this is the sweater for you!
131	1	a	Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.
132	1	a	I love the deep v - very flattering. bummed that it made with polyester, but it light and easy.
133	1	a	I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.
134	0	a	I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
135	1	a	This top is very flattering and the silver line details give it a great pop of color!
136	1	a	This is my 6th pair of rockets. they've become my hands down, favorite cut from citizens. for curvy girls, these are the perfect skinny jeans. they come up high enough to tuck everything in, no muffins top. they shape and lift my butt, which i need because i've got a generous one. they hold their shape amazingly well and do not require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape. they truly have been the holy grail of jeans, for me. with all that said, these are not a 5 star version of
137	1	a	I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i ca not wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
138	1	a	This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it a weird kind of greeny yellow
139	1	a	My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.
140	1	a	I really liked the beautiful fabric, design, and length of the piece.
141	1	a	This does run big but because it is cotton, it easily shrinks in the dryer. i love it! i do wish the color was more saturated/deeper.
142	1	a	I ordered this online in a sz 4, perfect fit and very comfortable. the side slits make it even more interesting since jeans or leggings will show!
143	0	a	As much as i wanted to love this top, it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.
144	1	a	These pants feel great. fit is true to size. the blue color is very unique. definitely recommend!
145	1	a	Love these crops. fitted through hips with full legs. at 5'7 and 125, the 27 fit perfect. these look great with block heels and wedges. denim is lightweight, perfect for fall.
146	0	a	After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately, the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it just not a flattering cut or material. going back!
147	1	a	"I bought the first one in the gold color, which i call mustard. i really love the high-low style and looks great when worn with a long necklace(s). when they went on sale, i bought two more, black and grey. i love that they are perfect for layering when it cold, but that i can also wear them alone, in other seasons. thy ran a bit large for me, so i was able to purchase the small. i am small boned, but large in the bust. i'm also short, 5'2"", but they do not look too long, especially when i wear"
148	1	a	Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.
149	0	a	I normally wear regular s, but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear. also, since the material is thin, the ivory is too shear for my liking.
150	1	a	These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!
151	0	a	Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i did not care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.
152	1	a	This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
153	0	a	Fun, sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return
154	1	a	Well made garment. i love the colors, fabric and flounce at the bottom. the top is a little large on top with large armholes, but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day.
155	0	a	This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.the only thing that i did not like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.
156	1	a	This dress is gorgeous in the photograph. and very pretty when it arrived, however, it is very dark in color. you would only notice the blue in bright light or perhaps outside in the sun. the fit was small. i could not get the tie around the waist to look right and feel comfortable, so sadly i had to return it. i applaud retailer for the excellent and attractive packaging. that was almost enough to sell the dress. it came in a very nice white box inside a larger box. tissue paper and fol
157	1	a	The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure.
158	1	a	I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.
159	1	a	I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket, so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium, and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.
160	1	a	This dress is simply unique beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown
161	1	a	I ordered this in the darker color. i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice, good quality and the design is so cute. sadly it did not work for me. there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape. i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs. i will be sending this back.
162	1	a	Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!
163	1	a	I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.
164	1	a	"Coh emerson style jeans are the best fit and style. the ""pacifica"" color is a light blue and nice for spring and summer. i love the slim boyfriend. i have thighs and they fit like a skinny without being super tight. there is just enough stretch. no holes either. they are easy to dress up or down and have become my new favorites."
165	1	a	Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly! yes it itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!
166	1	a	Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5, size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe.
167	1	a	Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'4 and 125 pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!
168	1	a	I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it a bit sheer, so i have to wear a tank under it and it a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top, especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4'', 120 pounds, and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.
169	1	a	Looove this so much. the color in person is a rich wine. the pintuck and button details are hard to see in the photo, but there are three buttons so you can chose to open a couple.
170	1	a	Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!
171	1	a	"I just purchased these joggers on-line during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts. i'm 5""4"" and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect. these are not super thick or anything so i think they'll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in. i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too."
172	1	a	The top is adorable and i love it. however the pink is not pink but more of a very faded orange color. i was really hoping for pink but the shirt is a keeper.
173	1	a	This is a charming dress, with lots of quality touches, and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however, the dress i received was not quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes, so you ca not button it. this makes the v lower, and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website, rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally, i w
174	1	a	I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.
175	1	a	I love this tank, it is casual and comfortable, but has the little scarf attached to it, so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular, and would need petite, it was a bit long on me, but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral, good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)
176	1	a	"I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9"", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well."
177	1	a	I received this dress as a birthday gift and am completely in love with it! there are some things about it that i wish i'd known (but are by no means deal breakers!). first, you can kind of see this in the model shot, the keyhole neckline is not sewn shut at all - it completely open. it did not cause problems for me, but some women may not be comfortable with that. my dress did not have any zippers and so was a pullover. the band that runs around the waist has little to no stretch, so you have t
178	1	a	I like this top, and while it does not look on me like it does the model, i think it will be good for work purposes. would say it runs big and does have the maternity look risk (i bought this two months postpartum, so i need tops that cover the post baby belly and this works for that purpose). the grey is nice. bought on sale, but would not recommend paying full price.
179	1	a	Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.
180	1	a	"I adore this dress, but i never would have bought it if i did not wear it with a belt. as some reviewers have said, it a sack. the belt takes care of this. it still is not a slimming dress, but i really do not mind--the elegance and comfort make up for it.i'm 5'10"", 34c, and curvy in the hips, and the medium fit perfectly. i could see this fitting strangely if you were larger in the bust."
181	1	a	As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.
182	1	a	"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it."
183	1	a	This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut, and it very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere, and it appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
184	1	a	I've been looking for a great long, loose, versatile vest for some time, and this is just about perfect. it slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate), but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger, and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!
185	1	a	I was very pleased with this purchase. lovely print, good fit, and silky fabric.
186	1	a	I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!
187	1	a	"Love the print so much!! it is a bit boxy, but for the length i needed to size up to a s from my usual xs with my long torso at 5'7"", 111lbs. i'm thinking that sizing up will also save me from any potential dryer accidents. but it does not really matter what size you get-just get it for the cute print scene!!"
188	0	a	This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however, the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.
189	1	a	I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.
190	1	a	"This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you ca not tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri"
191	1	a	These pants are great, as is the case with most c of h jeans. they are a perfect length if you are 5&#39;5&quot; or shorter (i.e. you don&#39;t need to cuff them several times). i love the relaxed but chic look. they run large so definitely size down at least one size. so happy they were on sale!
192	1	a	"Pretty color.love the lace.my husband thought it looked a little ""old lady-ish"", but i think it depends on what you wear it with....it been too hot here to wear yet. i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings!"
193	1	a	These are form fitting and have a great wash. the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear. the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots.
194	1	a	I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however, i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it going back.
195	0	a	"I did purchase the pants but ultimately ended up returning because everything such as the print and the length it hits at your ankles is great but there was, at least for me, a lot of extra fabric in the crotch area (and this is not to be crude, there really is not another word that i can use) and when you sat down, it is extremely apparent. i am 5""6' and run between a size 8 and 10 and 10 fit me, but again, i just think if there was less fabric in the saddle, it would not ride up and look more fl"
196	1	a	This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
197	1	a	This dress is everything i hoped it would be: flattering, cute, cozy
198	1	a	I really like the design and colors and the material is so soft and comfy. the top is a little on the short side so wearing a tank underneath is an option if you do not want your stomach to show when you raise your arms.
199	1	a	I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.
200	0	a	Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.
201	1	a	"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size."
202	1	a	This robe is so pretty, i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch. the fabric is very light and soft, i'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead. the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model. i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase.
203	1	a	These jeans are awesome! i usually wear a 26 in ag jeans as they tend to stretch, but i ordered a 27p because i am only 5'1 and these are a flare style. i have a small waist but a larger booty, and these jeans hug me in all the right places. they also have a great dark color and are super classy so you can dress them up if need be. the only thing i did not like was the length. even with the petite size i have to wear wedges so they do not drag on the ground. but, this is an issue i have with most
204	1	a	This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet, and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely would not wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me, and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!
205	1	a	The knit collar and the color and the drape is what makes this lilitz cardigan so wonderful and an excellent addition to my signature retailer sweater collection. as previous reviewers stated, the color is not orange but more of a marled rose yarn. the body of the sweater is lightweight, draped, stretchy and warm and the knit collar is much heavier. because of my body type (36ddd, heavy upper back, rounded shoulders) this cardigan does not look great on me when left open as the collar does not fall
206	1	a	I did like this top, but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great, the fabric is amazing, but it just did not fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size, but i just was not sure that i would wear it a lot.
207	1	a	I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.
208	1	a	They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously is not the ideal fit but it will manage. it very cute, but the colors are not as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.
209	1	a	"This dress has a beautiful fit--5'4"", 150 lbs, 34ddd, and the medium regular fit great. the only issue is that the bottom part of the dress wrinkles terribly. when i bought it, the woman folded it nicely, and i stashed it in my car for the rest of my shopping trip. when i arrived home and pulled it out, the bottom of the dress was horribly wrinkled. plus it dry clean only. going back. :("
210	1	a	This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white, but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!
211	1	a	"I ordered a xxs petite based on previous reviews but it was too short and snug in the shoulders. i then tried on the regular xs and it fit nice.y. loose but it is the style (shoulders fit). i usually need xs petite so kind of true to size to me. i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. color is nice, i liked the blue polka dot with flowery tie neck. the tie. neck is a. nice. on trend feature, can. be tired at different heights for different looks, i think i will keep the xs regular...."
212	1	a	This is a great staple top for your closet. its tremendously soft, a bit oversized, and drapes really lovely. in store there were also striped styles available, but i love the emerald green. the colors are absolutely perfect and will transfer well into any season! my only issue with this top (which inevitably is the reason i decided not to purchase) is the dolman sleeve. i'm al xl on top...so i'm never looking for extra width in anything i wear. the dolman sleeve really only looks right on me if
213	1	a	Gorgeous dress, colors as appear in picture, thick material- quality is good. sizing- im usually a size 2 or small, got a small, and it is big in the chest/ length is below the knee. would recommend a size smaller than normal. not a huge deal- small alteration job.
214	0	a	I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i ca not size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.
215	0	a	I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric is not working for me. i think it the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i'll have to pass.
216	1	a	I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable. it perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10.
217	1	a	Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.
218	1	a	Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin, which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.
219	1	a	"Such a cute dress but it runs large. i'm 5'4"" 130 lbs and am typically a size 4 can wear a size 2 in certain clothes. i tried on the xs and it was still too big. i would of bought it in an xxs but they are sold out. really a comfy laid back dress that would be comfortable in summer. if they get more xxs i'll buy it."
220	1	a	Flattering! i love how it looks like a maxi dress. fits me perfectly!
221	0	a	The quality of the fabric is good, but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.
222	1	a	"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on, i loved it. colors are muted, and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy, which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders, but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large, but went with a medium in this one so it would not be to"
223	1	a	Fits great, comfortable!
224	1	a	Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo
225	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl."
226	1	a	I tried these on to compare with a different style and did not like this one a much (also ag brand). these fit better at the waist, but seemed long on me and made me look frump ear. i think they are really comfortable, adn on the longer legs would be great. buy f you are taller than 5 foot 1.5 inches:-). (reference, i am 115 lbs and tried on the 25)
227	1	a	I have 9.5-10 size feet, and these are a bit small; the heel does not quite make it around my heel to where it supposed to be. still, they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors, and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.
228	1	a	"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done."
229	1	a	I ca not figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it too big but the length works), or if it supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.
230	0	a	I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
231	1	a	I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. did not know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend.
232	1	a	I am so pleased with this product. it is a great staple for every woman. my one complaint is that it easily pulls.. something to be mindful of when handling the garment.
233	0	a	I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i did not see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.
234	0	a	I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
235	1	a	This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it a must have.
236	1	a	This coat is so beautiful! like others i would not have even considered it online but i tried it on in the store and absolutely fell in love with. it is the softest material ever and is so flattering on.
237	1	a	Absolutely love! as others have mentioned, it super comfy and the colors in the bottom definitely brighten up the sweater. the online brand says monogram, but the tag says sleeping on snow....weird.
238	1	a	Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.
239	0	a	After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand, i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights, clinging to every part of your leg - there is not even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that is not happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
240	1	a	Thank goodness they had a special discount because i love this sweater. it is not normal for me to splurge but there was something about this sweater and it did not disappoint. too cute. a great top to wear to a concert or a relaxed party. i love it.
241	1	a	I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i could not find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.
242	1	a	"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."
243	0	a	"I thought this shirt dress was adorable but i am 5'8"" with long legs and the sides of the dress were cut just a little too high. nice soft material and i would have kept it if the sides had been an inch longer."
244	1	a	I was a bit worried when i took it out of the packaging but once i tried it on, all was well. it is a cute and comfortable outfit with enough detail to be stylish. i love rompers and this one is a great addition to the wardrobe.
245	1	a	Grabbed this off the sales rack-not expecting much-but it is a great sweater! like other reviewers mentioned-roomy but still form fitting. i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great. cozy, warm, very cute. i usually wear a small but got an xs in this. a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics.
246	1	a	"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
247	0	a	Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.
248	1	a	This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.it so comfortable and it made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it a pretty straight cut.
249	1	a	I love this vest! it is a great color and the inside is very soft! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down.if you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath.it amazing! i feel so confident in it!
250	1	a	Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
251	1	a	"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled"
252	1	a	"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t"
253	1	a	I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i did not have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th
254	1	a	I bought the white in my usual xs size, i do not agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.
255	1	a	I ordered the black and it was a soft black, which i loved. i felt like the shirt was a little boxy (i was hoping the top would have been a bit more fitted (the arm holes are loose) and the bottom a little longer, but i like it enough that i am keeping it. works well to wear to work.
256	0	a	I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
257	1	a	Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray, front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all.
258	1	a	Modern, unique, versatile; love it paired with the essential culottes. usually size 4/small but got the xs, otherwise the armholes dipped down too low as did the back hem of the sweater (
259	1	a	I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and, yikes, right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue, they were just as pictured/expected.
260	1	a	This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!
261	1	a	This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.
262	0	a	True to size and lovely dress, except the arm pit area is tight and pinches. had to return.
263	0	a	Loved the open shoulders, but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
264	1	a	"I am 5'6"", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."
265	1	a	Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!
266	1	a	I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the m/l and fits well.
267	1	a	"I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5'7"", 150 lbs, 36a) and it not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing"
268	1	a	Trying to hold back and not purchase this beautiful sweatercoat but 20% off on retailerday and reviews saying it ran large, i ended up getting it. my store stock only went up to l (i normally wear xl in retailer tops) but read that they ran large. i did try it on and it seemed to fit and is gorgeous, but once home i saw really it was too tight in the upper arms and i do not want to order the xl which might be baggy, so i'm exchanging it for 2 walking on snow sweater/jackets which are very flattering!
269	1	a	Wonderful and comfortable dress, very sweet.
270	0	a	I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which is not my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts did not work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
271	1	a	Hack: wrap the sash around waist twice and tie in back!! agreed with other reviewers it is a bit sack like when the sash tied in front as seen on model. but wrap twice, and it makes the silhouette pop. fabric is rediculously lush, and pattern is very sophisticated. stunning dress, will be wearing all summer -- with flats for work, with heels for evening. oop, my usual size, fits perfectly (5'4, 110 lbs).
272	1	a	This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!
273	1	a	This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i wo not be wearing it without tigh
274	1	a	I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i did not want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it does not stretch out much.
275	1	a	"While the blue color pictured is stunning, i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail, especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next, this white fabric crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque, but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!"
276	1	a	I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending. it fits great, is flattering, and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough.overall it was a great purchase!
277	1	a	I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th
278	1	a	I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!
279	0	a	This top does not at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.
280	1	a	"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better."
281	0	a	There is not a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric is not very soft, and it not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i was not too fond of the dress.
282	1	a	"Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a ""fat stage""...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it that good."
283	1	a	This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.it is fitted, but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis, this dress is a winner!
284	1	a	I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect.
285	1	a	Super cute pants, fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist, and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however, when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them.
286	1	a	Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90 style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.
287	1	a	I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.
288	1	a	True to size i found. got the medium and had a bit of room to spare. usually i'm a 6 on the lower half, (34-28-36).the upper portion is a very very light heathered grey, almost cream and yes, i found it to be see through.comfortable but either for lounging round the house only or wear a tunic to cya!
289	0	a	Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i do not think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (was not there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
290	1	a	I have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo. it runs small and the size 10 fits like a size 8 would fit . 145 lbs and curvy figure, flat tummy but have hips and tush. the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable. i love a-line styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces. it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp . website pho
291	1	a	This was my first dress purchase this year, quite late. i've been disappointed with a lot of polyester/rayon/viscose dresses so far. if it 100% silk or cotton, it quite expensive. this dress meets all my tick marks: no synthetic, beautiful pattern, well-made, flattering to the figure. i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me. fits true to my petite sizing. it a very easy to wear dress, no tugging with straps or a belt. it slimming and skims the figure properly.
292	1	a	I like this sweater but i'm not in love. the rib knit on the sleeves are too form fitting (not restrictive) on my chubby arms so it does not look flattering when i wear long sleeves. i do appreciate the mixed patterns and the soft moss colorway, it very pretty together. i purchased the medium petite and the length looks good. maybe i need the large because of my body type. i'll give it another chance when my paquerette gets here
293	1	a	This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and did not look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.
294	1	a	Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!
295	1	a	Beautiful dress! flowers and material look even better in person. loose fit.
296	1	a	I saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on. i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly. i ca not wait to wear this during the spring and summer. it really lightweight and soft which i love. i purchased the copper color, and would consider the color in the photo to be very true. this was definitely a splurge, but i am overall very happy with my purchase. i highly recommend it!
297	1	a	Love the colors and pattern. i am normally a m/l. i ordered a large as that all they had in stock and it fits fine though the medium would probably have fit a little better for me. it is very long, even for me and i'm 5' 9.
298	0	a	I have a collection of this artist paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried, i could not get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
299	1	a	I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.
300	1	a	This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy. i'd been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option. seems to be very versatile.
301	1	a	I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress, skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!
302	1	a	The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i do not see the need for a tank/cami under it. i
303	1	a	Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!
304	1	a	I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.
305	1	a	I love linen i know it a pain with the wrinkles but it just a very nice crisp clean feel. this vest is wonderful it fits very nice, once you size down, and can work as a bathing suit cover up. i'm using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get that...i think they're all gone by now but if they are not grab it while you can it a must have for any woman closet.
306	1	a	"Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3""). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy."
307	1	a	Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
308	1	a	This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!
309	1	a	Got this today and am really pleased. beautiful detail and i love how the cowl neck hangs. it not itchy at all. overall, a great find for the colder months ahead. i got a small and probably should have ordered xs instead. runs a little big on my petite frame.
310	1	a	This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!
311	1	a	Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.
312	1	a	I like the soft green color, the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.
313	1	a	Beautiful dress; however, the top was small for my chest and the rest ran large.
314	1	a	What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.
315	1	a	This is a nice year round weight sweater. i am thrilled with small details, true to retailer pieces.
316	1	a	"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i do not find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"
317	1	a	Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!
318	1	a	"Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it._____________pros:- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.- a definite winter piece. it extremely warm and very thick and heavy, which i found covered any lumps and bumps nicely.- ran tts. i'm 5'9"", 36c, hourglass, and 170 lbs and tried on the medium and fo"
319	1	a	Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.
320	1	a	"This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique, and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4, but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6"" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age, i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea"
321	1	a	This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.so i ended up returning it - only because i did not like the color on me.
322	1	a	I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it did not pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and does not drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
323	1	a	I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it not warm enough to wear by itself when it really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!
324	0	a	"I know this product description says oversized but that an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father jacket. i do not even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it just way too big."
325	1	a	This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it did not settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i did not
326	1	a	"I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2"" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress ca not fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som"
327	1	a	I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it does not compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i did not like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
328	0	a	This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.
329	1	a	Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for. in the store i was between a l and m. so went with the large. after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large. jacket is roomy warm and so so soft. added bonus w the hood.
330	1	a	"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2"", 115 lb body."
331	1	a	This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.
332	1	a	Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.
333	0	a	Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
334	1	a	Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-smalland it fits beautifully. plus, the weight of the knit is just right forchilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!
335	1	a	These are colors i normally never wear...baby pink, lavender, light blue...but what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in. it my favorite. i also adore a good poncho. this poncho is so rich and so heavenly. super soft, very oversized, incredibly nice fabric...its like a light weight sweater. lots of movement and such a statement piece, it will look great over a white tank top, or an all black ensemble with great boots. this only comes in two sizes but runs large. i'm 5'8 and curvy...and
336	1	a	I absolutely love these tees! i have them in almost every color - i find i can wear them with almost anything (can dress them up or down)....i feel like they are true to size. i purchased the small but i probably could have worn an xs too - i wanted a looser fit.also, they wash and dry well too!for reference: 32d, 27, 35
337	1	a	I love this thing. i bought it yesterday and already am wearing it today, and i have been known to leave things sitting around in my closet for awhile before i wear them, especially if they are not a sure thing. for reference, i am a curvy, busty size 14. i bought an xl but a l would have worked too. it has a drawstring on the inside back and on the bottom center back hem, so it can be adjusted for more shape through the waist. it has a beautiful drape, is very soft, and the embroidery makes it s
338	1	a	Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.
339	0	a	The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture, plain black. the back print is nice,just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.
340	1	a	"Color, fabric blend, and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately, i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso, or like the short look, i would recommend this!"
341	1	a	I love pilcros! i have a few pairs and all in 28s, so that what i ordered, however they are so tight i could even button them! i have not gained any weight and all my old pairs fit fine... i liked the color and length so much i'm exchanging them for 29s. hopefully that will do the trick!
342	1	a	This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie, the lace on the sides, the hem, the sleeves, the pleats at the chest, and the liner is opaque so it not see-through. but it very white, baby doll cut, and very short. in order to avoid the maternity, wedding-ish look, a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up, a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size 2 regular, and it still falls about 3 inches above m
343	1	a	In the quest to find comfy, cute, casual tops i took a change on this one. it cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just did not suit my coloring or body type, but i still recommend because it comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else closet.
344	1	a	This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!
345	1	a	This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m
346	1	a	This is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once. i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect. no bra showing beneath. yay! it is a beautiful color and design. just love it. i am a typical size 4/6 and size 6 was perfect. i am 36c and no problems in bust area. works well with my short torso. highly recommend. i think it will look great on all body types.
347	0	a	I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i ca not wear it. it going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it wo not shrink up several inches.
348	1	a	Love this dress. the color is beautiful. runs large so size down
349	1	a	Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you ca not really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans
350	1	a	Love this dress. it is simultaneously romantic, sexy and sweet. could be a casual dress but also worn with heels. it does run a little large but it is flowy and not meant to be super tight. i am 36d and the top is not too tight - ordered the size 4 and am very happy with the fit.
351	1	a	This is such a simple dress to throw on that will give you instant wow factor. you can dress up or down but know that it is completely flattering - head to toe. i am in love with this dress!
352	1	a	This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down.the slits are high, so you are exposed like a short shirt.
353	1	a	"Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i could not stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b"
354	1	a	I love jumpsuits in general. however, it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay! i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review! the waistband hits perfectly on me. i am 5'7 and about 160 and i bought the large. super easy to throw on!
355	1	a	"I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing. i am 5'6"" 130 and athletic build, it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model. i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt."
356	1	a	"Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year. looks much better in person then it does in the photo. she is 5'7"" and 135lb. we bought the size four. great length on her. green adds a nice pop of color. she loves it."
357	1	a	"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6"", 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it does not fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat"
358	1	a	"I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!"
359	1	a	This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.
360	1	a	Fell in love with this romper online, but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large, i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering, delicate details and lined! it adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium, but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.
361	1	a	"Great quality coat! very pretty colors and love the sleeves! i would have given 5 stars, but like other reviewers stated, this coat does she'd. best not to wear black. it is a slight ""swing"" style coat, so it not fitted at the waist and hips, but very stylish. i found it best to size down. i'm 5'4 118lb, but i'm large chested (32dd) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest, but the six was too big. the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater!"
362	0	a	I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it way too long.
363	1	a	I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i could not imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.
364	1	a	I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.
365	1	a	"Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors..........."
366	0	a	"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors"
367	1	a	Gave this to a friend as a gift. soft, lovely. she loves it.
368	1	a	I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!
369	0	a	I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i do not know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
370	1	a	"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and did not outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable, but it did not feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture."
371	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous. i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it, but the cost was a deterrent. when it went on sale, i ordered it immediately. hoping it gets here soon! the fit is wonderful, length perfect, embroidery just beautiful, and quality is excellent. it is versatile, too; easy to dress down with a sweater and boots, and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding. for fit reference, i am 5'8"", 130 lb and ordered size 6 (this was the correct fit in the store). exci"
372	1	a	I am 5'4, 34b, 106lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. it comes just above my knee so i could also have worn the petite and would have been fine if it was shorter too. i rarely wear green but this shade is so pretty.
373	1	a	I got the red, which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute, but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return, but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)
374	1	a	"I've eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it. i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size. i'm 5'4-3/4"", 36c-32-37 with a drop-waist that measures 34. based on the reviews, i ordered a regular size 6. i tried it on with a bra and also without, and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways. but for complete comfort, i'll probably go without the bra (the lining and design do not show anything you do not want seen!). sitting in it feels great too. i"
375	0	a	This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately
376	1	a	When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out! in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store. well, these are described as lim, tailored' in details, so decided to order my usual size 6 regular. upon arrival, they were baggy in the thigh area, the rise was fine but the crotch area -pardon me- was a little on the short side. buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole & unbuttoning was a job! guess the hol
377	1	a	"If you're a girl with no junk in the trunk buy these pants! they make you look like you are working with something! i love them. i am 5'3"" and always struggle to find pants that are not too long and that will help me not look like an ironing board. these are great. not too long in regular and like another reviewer said, you'll have a booty. great lightweight pants."
378	0	a	I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.
379	1	a	"This is the perfect sweater for early spring; lightweight; but not too thin. i""m 5'2"", 125 lbs. the medium fits perfect."
380	0	a	I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.
381	1	a	I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red, but was sold out and do not have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit, flirty, flattering, very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned, the fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment, no biggie, i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering, chest area not too snug, and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs, 26.5 in
382	1	a	Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate
383	1	a	This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!
384	1	a	I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.
385	1	a	Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and does not wrinkle easily.
386	0	a	I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
387	1	a	The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on.
388	1	a	This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am, it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.
389	0	a	I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother day promotion on all items. based on the model photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs
390	1	a	These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.
391	0	a	This dress had a nice silhouette, but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!
392	1	a	"I got this top in navy and i love it. it loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
393	1	a	This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful.i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias.i ordered a size two regular, even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length.---->in the picture, the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model, the sleeves are 3/4 and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are, or if the sleeves reache
394	1	a	"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand..i tried a size 2 and it fit fine, just above my long waist ( 5'2"", currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2, depending on my weight, and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it sold out now..the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
395	1	a	"These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9""/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered. (i also own a pair of 100% cotton levi wedgie in foot hills in size 27 which fit a bit different than these -- the foot hills definitel"
396	1	a	Love this dress? very flattering fit, though it runs big. i usually wear a s/m and got an xs in this dress. the only concern is the fabric is thin, but love it nonetheless.
397	1	a	These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
398	0	a	I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
399	0	a	I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts. like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly. it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
400	1	a	Love this sweater! bought it in pink and grey and it looks great with jeans. great quality and true to size.
401	1	a	This is a beautiful dress and it was hard to let it go but, unfortunately, because the fabric is a little stiff, it accentuated my curvy back side in a bad way. it will definitely look great on someone with a smaller bottom. i tried the xs and did not experience the issues that other reviewers mentioned, such as the large arm holes.
402	1	a	I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.
403	1	a	I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt. it is adorable! saw it in the store. it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear. i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly. i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out. colors are southwesternish. can be worn with any color top. i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.
404	0	a	I am a true size xl. in my 20s i wore a small and then medium, so i know whereof i am speaking here. i tried this dress on in my local retailer store. this designer, as a handful of retailer designers seem to do, simply enlarges the fabric measurement outward as they add another size. the problem is... a funny thing happens to women breasts as they gain weight. is this so difficult to understand? as a size small i was an a cup, as a medium i was a b cup. now, years later, as a size 16 i am a d cup
405	0	a	Super soft fabric, however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl, normally wear 12/14. i had to return it.
406	0	a	I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return.
407	1	a	The pictures of this dress are terrible compared to seeing it in person, and i instantly fell in love with this dress when i put it on. the fit is very flattering with a touch of 1920s flare. the colors are better in person too, with the lightest color being pink, not white as pictured.
408	0	a	Wanted to love this.. love rompers, but the opening between your chest was oddly designed, it was gapping and certainly could not bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full, made me feel frumpy..
409	1	a	Love this top- great for summer- unique in the print. feels great on, a little loose but great for a hot texas summer.
410	1	a	Great tee! the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality. it much darker in real life, but otherwise it a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits. i bought it in a s and it roomy without being oversized. great for fall....
411	1	a	These are a lovely neutral to slightly warm grey pair of jeans from a great line. i wore my usual size without issues.
412	1	a	"I absolutely love this top and it looks absolutely fabulous (the first time you wear it). the details are impeccable and you'll get compliments all day long. i paired it with a jean jacket and my favorite ""destroyed"" skinnies for an outing in tx wine country. there are a couple of key things to note. when you pull this top on... mind your make-ups. you can and will get make-up on the collar... and so, apply this shirt on carefully... or your make-up (vice-versa). now, after the fist wear, which"
413	1	a	I ordered this top in a xs which is what i usually wear in most tops. a little big but just shrunk it. very comfy and love the color.
414	1	a	The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress
415	1	a	I bought this dress for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it! she tells me she has worn it many times and gets compliments each time on both the style and the color (ordered the orange). it a lovely lightweight knit and is easy to dress up or down, plus it is so comfortable and flattering!
416	1	a	Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they do not come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.
417	1	a	This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.
418	1	a	Form fitting, hugs in the right spots, and love the pattern. it a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however, an excellent evening dress.
419	1	a	I received so many compliments on this dress. i purchased my usual size 12 and it fit fine. i agree with some other reviewers that i could have probably gone a size down for a more snug fit.
420	1	a	"I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality, slim fit, high-waisted jeans, either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige, thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft, yet has that little ""snap"" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there are not those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27, which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a"
421	0	a	I ordered one of each color in size xl. the fit is true to size. it matches the model photos. there a lot of material so it flowy. but, it shrunk with air-drying. the colors are very pretty in person. the white is bright. i decided to keep mine even though they're truthfully, unflattering to wear. the way the sleeves are slightly gathered and cut, make my shoulders & arms look huge. i do not have the shape to pull this off. but, for wearing at home in the summer, they're worth having. the m
422	1	a	These are called jeans but they are not exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!
423	0	a	I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
424	1	a	Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!
425	1	a	I like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath. it can be worn in many seasons. i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan. cute dress!
426	1	a	I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.
427	1	a	"I love everything about this top. first, it super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8"" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store did not have the wine color or i would have purchased it too."
428	1	a	I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.
429	0	a	I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
430	1	a	"I love this dress. it is a fun and flirty summer dress. i think it can be dressed up or worn casually. i am a 36c, 29"" waist, 40"" hips. i bought a size 8 and it fits me great. as others said, it is a little snug across the chest, but i think it is supposed to be. with the proper bra it fits very comfortably! i am going to wear it for mother day brunch!"
431	0	a	I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it somewhat fitted on the top yet it a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin
432	1	a	This vest is not only stylish and beautiful, it also has pretty specks of blue and rust and other colors. will go with so much. i love the collar, not too big, not too small, just right. frames the face nicely. can wear with dresses, can wear with skirts, can wear with jeans, can wear with cords, the list is endless. this will make any outfit look pulled together. the accompanying belt or sash hits at hip level, i personally like it more at waist level so i remove the belt and wear without it. f
433	1	a	I read other reviews that there was extra fabric in the stomach area and knew it'd be perfect for me to wear to a wedding at 20 weeks pregnant. and it was! i got tons of compliments. it accented my baby bump perfectly, fitted but not too tight. the pleats at the top create a nice shape for the bump. very comfortable for an outdoor wedding. my only complaint is that the armholes are rather tight. after pregnancy i will try belting the dress.
434	0	a	I ordered this in my usual size 0 and could not finish zipping up the top, but also could not fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f
435	1	a	This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i would not of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
436	1	a	I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.
437	0	a	"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return."
438	1	a	"I'm all over this trend, but this vest is quite thick/poufy, and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me, a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4"" do not hesitate."
439	1	a	Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.
440	1	a	"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online does not do it justice. a couple of things, the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip, which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it really fun and festive with the collar,"
441	1	a	I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i was not totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.
442	1	a	I am in love with this tunic, i wear it with everything, jeans, leggings and just tights! super comfy, quality design. runs a bit large but i like that.
443	1	a	I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:_________________pros:- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)- the length is ideal for taller folk.- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this wo not be an issue.- nicely conservative at the top.cons:- i
444	1	a	This dress is very figure flattering. however, it is not navy it purple. overall nice print, somewhat cheap material and zipper gets stuck. i am keeping because it versatile and i like the vintage floral pattern.
445	0	a	I was so excited to order this dress, had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
446	1	a	Love, love, love this top. so flattering and forgiving. bought it in white - great for summer!
447	1	a	I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems
448	1	a	The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top, it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure, and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.
449	1	a	Nice top that can be worn alone or underneath a sweater. can be dressed up or down and worn in all seasons.
450	1	a	"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re"
451	1	a	I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!
452	1	a	I really ca not say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch, are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also, the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.
453	0	a	So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
454	1	a	I have been looking for flares that are not tight through the thigh and these are definitely them...but for me they were so long that to hem them would ruin the style of the pants. i'm 5'5 and have long legs but i would need a high heel to maintain the intended style, and that not what i was looking for. otherwise, beautiful.
455	0	a	Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines did not make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.i wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely.
456	1	a	"I'm in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store. if you do not have enormous shoulders (which i do) , i think the petite would fit someone in the 5'6"" range. what i'm trying to say is the dress is pretty long. the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary. i've been reading marie kondo book and this one ""sparks joy""!"
457	1	a	This is a nice top! it is dressy and cute, tts. i am 8 or 10 and got a med. would look great with jeans, pencil skirts, slim cut pants. very happy with this purchase.
458	1	a	I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit, style, and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly.
459	1	a	I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean, any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but, overall this is an adorable dress, very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased, but that all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!
460	1	a	This top is so pretty and easy to wear. the material is super soft, it long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked. the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off! great purchase on retailer weekend, i'd be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale.
461	1	a	I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.
462	1	a	I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown, which it was, but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little
463	1	a	This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat
464	1	a	This is a simple shirt, but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton, and though i adore retailer, i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy, because i prefer the feel of silk, linen and cotton. thanks for this one, retailer!
465	1	a	"This is a perfect sweater. it comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.tts. 5'7"" 127 lbs 34b wearing this in size small"
466	1	a	I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6, i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace, the length, color and detail on this one. it also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:)
467	1	a	"I'm 5'8"" about 134, somewhat of a pear, and these jeans in size 28 fit like they were made for me. plus, the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color. ankle opening is more straight than skinny, which is a change from my usual skinny jeans, but i like it."
468	1	a	This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it was not paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.
469	1	a	"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me, even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model, maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g"
470	1	a	"I bought this in-store after seeing it online, and am in love with the shape! the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion. for reference i'm 5'6"" 120lbs and a bcup. i got the xs. the torso was too baggy and lost it shape with a small. as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white. it has a modern cut and is very versatile. i plan to wear"
471	1	a	I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!
472	1	a	"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!"
473	1	a	I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.
474	1	a	I sized down in this and it fit perfectly! i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering . adorable and well made!
475	0	a	I was disappointed in this bordeaux top, a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium, my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also, the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra, the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.
476	1	a	Love this tee! the fit is true to size, and very flattering shaping. not too tight, not too baggy, good length. i love the stitching detail on the top. the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it. my only concern is that it says to hand wash, dry clean acceptable. i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking. i'm not going to risk it and dry clean it. normally i would not want that expense or hassle.
477	1	a	The other reviewers are right, this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i'm 5'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it'd be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you.
478	1	a	The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit, just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch, which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric did not make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt.
479	1	a	I ca not wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it nice to be able to wear a bit of
480	1	a	"I do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny, but its nothing that a simple tack ca not fix. this suit looks incredible on, and does a good job of hiding my ""mom pooch"" while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts. also covers the chest area well."
481	1	a	"I've been scouting retailer store, looking for short sleeved tops at a reasonable price point.this fit the bill. the flouncy sleeves are a bit much for my typical wardrobe, but a fun addition. i love the fact that there extra fabric built in to make the armholes smaller, therefore no need for a cami underneath.i purchased the black and white in medium (typically medium to large, 5'4"", 34g)."
482	0	a	The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it was not see through i would keep it.
483	1	a	My daughter tried this on in the store yesterday and loved it. it fits perfectly; true to size - the quality of the fabric and style is lovely. a fun jacket to layer with.
484	1	a	I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but did not like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.
485	1	a	This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website. i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again. i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on. perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo. you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt. i wore it to a work meeting and ca not wait to wear it again. it a bit on th
486	1	a	"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"", 115lbs i prefe"
487	1	a	"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i did not need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
488	1	a	I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i do not want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it the right shape to flow gently. it just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it flattering. not sure if it will fla
489	1	a	"The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2"", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos."
490	1	a	I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.
491	1	a	"These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering! i bought the taupe in sp, for reference i'm 5'2', 115 lbs., curvy on bottom. i was afraid it would give me a ""bubble butt"" and it did not. could be dressed up with right shoes/accessories."
492	1	a	This dress is nicely made and hangs beautifully. i did find the shoulders a bit too wide even though i have pretty broad shoulders. then again, i'm also pretty tall and the length on this dress is really nice, so i'll take the slightly wide shoulders. the low back and gathered waist are very flattering. a perfect dress to wear in the summer!
493	1	a	This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you wo not regret it.
494	0	a	I purchased the dusty rose. i thought the picture represented the color accurately. the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape. it felt very luxurious. the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable.in the end i am disappointed in the care information provided by the site. it listed the garment as machine washable but the care label in the garment states it is dry clean only. i would not have purchased it if i would have know that. i am going to have to return it for this rea
495	1	a	The dress is true to size, but has generous stretch to it. i absolutely love this dress, i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid, for me the tummy!
496	1	a	"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs."
497	1	a	Love this dress! but do not wash it! it shrinks about 2 inches making it way too short for me! it should be dry clean only!
498	1	a	I was returning something to the store. before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes. it such a nice skirt, with the gorgeous red color, beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft. i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together. it is tts, i'm 5'5 and 120lb and i usually get 0-2 in size. size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size 2 and it fits me very well. the length is great, it falls 2-3 in
499	1	a	I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so, if you want a more tailored, but loose fit, then size down.but, it is not boxy. and, the deep v is sexy, but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk, but it just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability, like when you drive. there is not much pull. it a thin light material and very cool for hot, humid summer
500	1	a	Interesting and different cut. sleeves are very long as pictured and that goes for xs----and i have long arms---hit the end of fingertips. the orange is burnt orange and on the brighter side. did not really work for me---did not want to be bothered with the sleeve thang.
501	1	a	"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and did not even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons do not pull at a"
502	1	a	Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you are not doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate
503	0	a	The shirt is nice, but not as nice a material as i was hoping, but i kept it anyway. but after washing it, it is even more disappointing, not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me, but would not recommend it especially for the price.
504	1	a	"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fit perfectly. the length was great too. as one reader noted, the zipper can be a little tricky but dont let that deter you from getting a pair of these sweet duds. it stretchs out a little as the day goes by but that is bearable. it has a hint of pink to it too. can be dressed up for the office or dressed down."
505	0	a	I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
506	1	a	I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
507	1	a	I love the feel and design of this pullover. it is extremely soft and comfy to wear. however, i did find that it runs slightly large, is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy. probably not the best for a petite frame. i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides.
508	1	a	I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i could not decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i did not want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it
509	1	a	"I love ag jeans. i own several pair, and i think they wash well, and wear well. that being said, i'd never purchased a pair of the ""stevie"" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag, and i like that the ankles are not true skinny jeans, but have a little width. it more on-trend for this season. for me, the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived, they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except, w"
510	1	a	Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!
511	1	a	Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!
512	1	a	"I purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online. i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me. i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it a little to short on my 5'9"" frame. well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top."
513	1	a	I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu. i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia
514	1	a	Cute and comfy. seems to fit true to size. flattering and roomy on top for my 34ddd shape, but does not make me look pregnant or fat overall, which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape. super cute!
515	1	a	These shorts just did not work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color, but i just do not have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.
516	1	a	Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good qualityi ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.
517	0	a	Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
518	1	a	I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue - gorgeous color! i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants, but i decided to keep them anyway. they are the most comfortable pants i've ever worn - butter soft. i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties, and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms. i highly recommend these pants!
519	1	a	"I love this top. i am 5'8"", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!"
520	0	a	Low waisted, weird liner.
521	1	a	I love an all cotton shirt! feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top
522	0	a	I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that ca not withstand washing?!
523	1	a	Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.
524	1	a	This is a fantastic dress! i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments. the fit is phenomenal; the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. i am full-figured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size. this dress would look good on an 18 year old or a 70 year old!
525	1	a	As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i do not want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep
526	1	a	Cute, comfortable, easy to wear, even on my hourglass figure. ca not decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it does not look frumpy.
527	1	a	"Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#"
528	1	a	"I love it! i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit, but it well worth the money. i'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, and my stomach is my biggest problem area. i ordered a size 8 and it a perfect fit and very flattering."
529	0	a	I love the idea of this top, but wish there was not so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
530	1	a	"I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8"" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch."
531	1	a	I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.
532	1	a	This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt ca not help) for nye. love this dress!
533	1	a	This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.
534	1	a	I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.
535	1	a	This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.
536	0	a	With a rather large chest, i am always having to size up in tops like this. the l fit well all over but the arm holes were just too low. even if i wore a navy bra (i got the navy version) it would still be cut too low. it too bad because it is a beautiful and unique piece
537	1	a	This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you do not see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed.it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 (
538	1	a	This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i do not wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.
539	1	a	I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i do not often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! ca not wait to wear these throu
540	1	a	I tried the black cat pattern in the store and it was cute, but the sleeves tend to run quite slim while the bodice is loose. so be aware you may want to size up if you ever have issues with tight sleeves.
541	1	a	"I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5"" 115 and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!"
542	1	a	This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress. it really comfortable, true to size and the cut is flattering. you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals. i did not want to take it off. sizing is straightforward on this one: just order your regular size. there nothing tricky about sizing. the xxsp (my regular size, depicted here), was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description. great buy. waiting for boston weather to coope
543	1	a	Maybe i did not read the description correctly, but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits, thigh-level, rather than just one, as shown in the photo above. it gorgeous silk, the patterns are vivid, and the pleats are classy, giving just the right balance of form and flow. however, when i sat down, very little coverage!! ...which means i would not wear it much. i considered taking it to my tailor, but too much effort and $$. however, it beautifully crafted if you're looking for som
544	1	a	This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really does not do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it a stunner!
545	1	a	I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers. got compliments at work. they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material. i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe would not feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.
546	1	a	Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer, it is the most fabulous cut, super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless, i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.
547	1	a	I tried these jeans on in my regular size and they seemed way too big, but still kinda cute. i went one size down and suddenly they were the most adorable, comfortable jeans that i've every had (and i have a lot of jeans!). i love them! they are very soft with gorgeous fading around the pockets. they are button fly which is unique. i got them on the sale on sale price and they are well worth every bit and more. i plan on wearing them with boots although high heal shoes should be beautiful with t
548	1	a	I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i was not even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.
549	1	a	These are super cute on. they shorts-length lining inside, which is great.
550	1	a	I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair.
551	1	a	The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.
552	0	a	I ordered size large and find this to be way too oversized, wide, long and unattractive on my frame. the print is just okay but since it does not wow me, i'm returning.
553	0	a	I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online do not do it justice. it heavy and luxurious, wonderful for fall or winter, and the gold, gray, and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus, pockets! however, the midi length did not work for me, despite the product suggestion that it was a universally flattering length, just above the knee. i'm not
554	1	a	"I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2"", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself"
555	1	a	This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.
556	0	a	I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
557	1	a	For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!
558	1	a	"I love pj and other assorted lounging pieces, and this one is exceptional. in fact, i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store, and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.the fit is tts. fyi: 36c, short waist, broad shoulders, 5'3""i normally wear a m/l in a chemise, and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room, but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves, without showing bumps"
559	1	a	"I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but ca not go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.ruffle is a great addition too..."
560	1	a	I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i do not want to deal
561	1	a	My daughter had one and wore it with everything.i ended up getting one myself.it is a perfect weight.
562	1	a	Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.
563	1	a	I also agree with the other reviewers that it important to try on a couple due to pattern differences. this dress has a beige base- the photo is a little misleading. i ended up returning it because the colors did not do much for me, i think they look great on the model but that because the beige does not blend into her at all. i also think it a little overpriced for what the dress is- a great summer day dress.
564	1	a	This skirt is so beautiful!! it a bit small, but only a tad. i can still wear it, and it encourages me to lose 5lbs haha! i get compliments everywhere i go.
565	1	a	This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.
566	1	a	I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it! i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall. it super comfy and appropriate for work.
567	1	a	"Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i'm 5""10"" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i'm a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i'm all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn'"
568	1	a	I ordered the green and lilac. the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option. i found that it ran true to size, but was a loose fit. the lilac color had white streaks from the the-dyed effect, but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on. for now, i am keeping the green one, but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model. i do like that it is 100 percent cotton and very so
569	0	a	I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there was not a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
570	1	a	This top fit nicely and was tts, but the pattern was different than i expected. i thought it would be more of a desert scene and it turns out there are cowboys on it and it just did not fit my style. if there were cowgirls on it i would have kept it.
571	1	a	"First of all, this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute, but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit, i am 5'6"", 123lbs. 27 inch waist, 32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my"
572	1	a	"I ordered this dress, and loved, loved it. beautiful, great fabric. the length was even perfect for me and i'm 5'4"". i am usually a size 8, but ordered up to a 10 because i am a little woman with the exception of my chest. i have ordered dresses before from retailer where i had to order certain dresses a size larger and they worked. unfortunately this time, it was not to be. tried the dress on and it fit nicely until the side zipper got to my chest area. i would have ordered another size lar"
573	1	a	I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i did not find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.
574	1	a	This dress is fantastic. i ca not help but think the other gals who gave this a low rating were perhaps more petite and did not size down. i am 5'8 and usually a 10-12. purchased the 8 and it is great! fits wonderful and looks so nice for the price. i like clothing that does not touch me and this does a great job, without looking sloppy.
575	1	a	I am pleasantly surprised by this purchase. i went back and forth on buy-in this, but ended up trying it out. so glad i did! it is very flattering and a very nice color. it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall.
576	0	a	"I did not realize when i ordered, that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look, especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist, rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7"" and i do like fuller skirts, but was"
577	1	a	"I love the perfect length of these! i am 5'6"" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!!"
578	0	a	I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''. love most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return.
579	1	a	"I ordered this in the white in my usual size 26, and these were too big on me (5'5"", 110lbs). the pants bunched up unattractively around my thighs because they were not form-fitting. i am hoping to exchange for the size 25 because i prefer a tighter fit. the style of the pants were very cute. i like the side slit detail and the cropped look. i'm hoping these pants work out for me in the smaller size."
580	1	a	I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.
581	1	a	I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30 and she loved the romper.i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item.
582	1	a	I got this skirt earlier this week and wore it for the first time today. i love the color and the shape. everyone else loved it on me. it looked great with a buttondown. but, i will say that it short. i'm usually a petite in bottoms, and i wore tights so i would not flash anyone when i bent down. i can only imagine how it would be on a taller girl. it also fits at the natural waist instead of the hip. i'm usually a size 6 in bottoms, but i bought the size 4 because it sits higher up.
583	1	a	Cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me. fits great on my shoulders/chest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt. i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try. i do not think i have the right personality for this one. looks great on everyone else i've seen wearing it!
584	1	a	It a pretty dress, my only concern is the sleeve length. it an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or, if you are a savvy sewer, you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6, but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you do not order the correct size.
585	1	a	I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i ca not wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles.
586	1	a	I love how this long sweater drapes. it soft -feels great on - and looks fabulous over leggings or skinnys!
587	1	a	Wonderful fabric, drapes nicely from waist= flattering, use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight, patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual
588	1	a	This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
589	1	a	Just received and tried it on right away. really flattering fit and comfortable! unusual neckline that you can wear plain or accessorize. i'm so happy i decided to take a chance on this one!
590	1	a	"From the website picture (in particular, the gray one) this may appear to be ""over-sized."" i can assure you, it is not. i have to return the small i ordered on the over-size assumption, and hope the medium (my usual size) fits because it a really nice top. the sleeves and the pattern of the weave give it good pizzazz."
591	1	a	Purchased this tee online and could not be happier with what arrived in my mailbox. this tee is perfect to throw on to run errands or out to lunch. the fabric is so soft, fit is true to size, i do not like tight fitting shirts, if you do i suggest ordering down a size. overall great detail, fit and just as pictured!
592	0	a	"These were great pants that fit well, had good rise, perfect stretch for my curves, and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10"", 165lbs, with a pear shape). after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week, at most), and following wash instructions perfectly, they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn, the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch, and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've"
593	1	a	I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i'm long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei
594	0	a	Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type, so might work for someone else, but sending back.
595	1	a	I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.
596	1	a	Adorable top, but it runs very small. i usually take a 4, but thought it may shrink up so i ordered a 6. it was a bit tight through the bust (34a), so i sent it back for an 8.
597	1	a	This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?
598	1	a	This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty. love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move. very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.
599	1	a	I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.
600	1	a	This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i ca not see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!
601	1	a	Great pair of work slacks with a flare. wear these with boots give a very rich look. super flattering cut and flat waist.highly recommend these for fall through winter!
602	0	a	This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure.
603	1	a	I was debating getting the petite vs. regular sizing. i ended up going with the regular sizing for the addition couple of inches in length. it is very comfortable and not at all a sweatshirt but more of a heavyweight, wider long sleeve.
604	1	a	I love this shirt. great mix of chic, comfortable and feminine! can wear for many occasions!
605	1	a	I love this dress. it beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i could not see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.
606	1	a	Great length, very comfortable, very pretty. perfect dressy winter skirt!
607	1	a	This dress is gorgeous, but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back.
608	1	a	"Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer. the dress detail is noted as a ""swing silhouette"" & should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor. the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink. a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect!"
609	1	a	I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.
610	1	a	Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it does not fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .
611	1	a	Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
612	1	a	Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; could not choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style is not too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric, but i had a gift card, and it is retailer after all.
613	1	a	The deep v does not gape, and flatters the neckline, while the waist-high side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless. the material is so lovely and soft and comfy, but clings in the right places to really flatter, while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way.
614	1	a	I liked this top even though it was a definite wing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer.
615	1	a	Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i'm 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable .
616	1	a	I purchased this tee in the neutral motif. i love it, it is comfortable and it linen (my favorite fabric) it drapes well and the birds on branches with blossoms and fruit on the side are a beautiful understated touch.
617	1	a	"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs and the m fits perfectly. it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy. pattern is really nice. great dress!"
618	1	a	"I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday, it is perfect! the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute. i'm 5'3"" bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well."
619	1	a	Loved this top! bought it during the recent promo and thought the sale price more fair. i sized up because i wanted a swing-ier silhouette and more room at the neckline. the top is impeccably made and the embroidery is sturdy. i did not find the top see-thru and am wearing it with a racer back black bra and have no issues.
620	1	a	"I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted ""just another cover-up"". in the final analysis, even at $35 (30% off 49.99), it just hung there. if that what you're after, then this is for you."
621	1	a	"The pattern ""camouflages"" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft, great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out."
622	0	a	The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt is not that fabulous either.
623	1	a	I love this piece! they're calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants. i usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall. size down to avoid the potato sack look. i think this piece is so great for fall. definitely a must buy!
624	1	a	"If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it not very binding, s"
625	1	a	"I tried the size 2, regular in store. they were a bit roomy and since i am 5'3"", i was glad that they were offered in petite. they did not carry petites in the store so they ordered a petite 0 for me. i tried them on when i received them and they fit like they had been tailor made for me. the rise was a bit short but not a deal breaker, however, they were very long and i hoped that i had shoes that were high enough. i often hem pants but figure when i buy petites there is no need. also, the hem"
626	0	a	This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line, but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out, but based on the length on me, it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference, i am 5'8 with a long torso.
627	0	a	I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week, but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i was not sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and did not end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then do not match up from the
628	1	a	This dress is very, very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long, coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there, it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i ca not wait to wear it!!
629	1	a	"I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it does not look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit."
630	0	a	The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
631	1	a	I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
632	1	a	"Love this dress! i ca not say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! does not wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1"" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses."
633	1	a	"I loved this on the mannequin and assumed it would look terrible on me. i tried it on anyway and was delightfully surprised. i tried a small and it was too roomy in the top so i opted for the extra small. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, (27 in jeans, 34a). my booty definitely fills it out but the rest of the fit is similar to the model. it is hard to get on and off but if you tie a looser bow before slipping it over your head it much easier to get back on and you can tighten it up again fairly easily. f"
634	1	a	Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it.
635	1	a	These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.
636	0	a	I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.i am still
637	1	a	Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely, hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short, i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.
638	0	a	"I really wanted to love this, but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref, i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area, but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it was not that i did not realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back, but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look"
639	0	a	"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t"
640	1	a	I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up, i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip, so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want, but i really love these shorts, so it not a deal breaker. overall, i am happy with them, but definitely size up!
641	1	a	I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.
642	0	a	This knit shirt is too thin, as most knit shirts i find are. i got this in the white, and was excited to try it on due to the fitted cut and cap sleeves. the upper part was great but the waist was too large for me, and was actually too long. had to return, especially for the cost. i purchased the xxs , which normally fits me.
643	0	a	"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl dress on me"
644	1	a	The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt is not heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.
645	1	a	I tried this on in the store, and the fabric is lovely - so, so soft and drapey. the skirt is very flattering - good length. but the zipper! the zipper was already ripped away from the fabric, so i was not able to purchase it. such a shame.
646	1	a	I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.
647	0	a	Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!
648	1	a	Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i ca not wait to take it out for a spin!i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!
649	1	a	This dress is gorgeous. the fabric is thick and layered with well designed lines. since the fabric is thick, it gives very little around your body. i have wide hips, a big butt and bust so this dress unfortunately was not a good fit for me. i usually fit in a 6 petite and for this one i got an 8. it fit around my bust and hips, but was bunched up in the back. i would definitely at least give this dress a try because it was very beautiful.
650	1	a	This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size.
651	0	a	The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but did not flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and did not sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).
652	1	a	I was not able to purchase this item because i just could not get the size right in the bust. the small puckered at the bust and i swam in the medium. bummed because the colors are so vibrant and pretty and the length and flow were great!
653	1	a	Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.
654	1	a	The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress. the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch, i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines
655	1	a	"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!"
656	1	a	"I thought this dress was beautiful and the quality is amazing. i thought it was going to be black and gold, but it has a lot of brown in it as well. i ordered a petite. i'm 5'61/2"" and the petite was just above my knees whereas the regular came below my knees. this is a dress i can wear to many events."
657	1	a	I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.
658	1	a	When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair
659	1	a	"For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i' 5' 4"" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said ""frumpy"" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out."
660	1	a	I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again
661	1	a	Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious, i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
662	0	a	The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just was not right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
663	1	a	I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it did not thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.
664	1	a	I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.
665	1	a	This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down, it a staple in my summer wardrobe.
666	1	a	"I like what they were going for here, and the fabric. but it falls short in that i ca not wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i ca not wear my normal bras, and the very wide neck also shows bra straps, so unless i want to go with a strapless bra, it not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without, but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
667	1	a	I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and was not sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so do not expect dark
668	1	a	I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it basic black, but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer, and it stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit, depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined, which is a big plus. i was
669	1	a	Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.
670	1	a	"These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8"" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i did not find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal."
671	1	a	Lovely, warm sweater. excellent quality, fits as shown on model
672	1	a	These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.
673	0	a	I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately, this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well, it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the
674	1	a	"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit."
675	1	a	I was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews, i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small [catch on the hips] in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer, too. the back is fine because it longer. it definitely wearable though. i would not recommend it for a work function if you're a bit taller. despite all of that, i really do like dress. it a new favorite. i ordered the blue --- love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it
676	1	a	Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love
677	1	a	Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i ca not wait to wear it!
678	1	a	This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it a perfect fit.
679	1	a	I saw this dress in a store the other day. it is so cute in real life. i do not think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on. the dress is well-made and it fit perfectly. in fact, it is quite flattering. i am so happy i saw it in the store. even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online, but do not because it is worth every penny.
680	1	a	Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots, flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time
681	1	a	This top was so beautiful, exactly like the image shows but the waist was so tight. it was uncomfortable enough that i am going to return it. sad because the top and arms fit great. i am an hourglass so my waist is very small compared to my top and bottom. oh well, next time!!
682	1	a	"This is just as it looks. a minimalist, elegant, dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight, so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it."
683	0	a	This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
684	1	a	I ordered the petite in my size, since i'm well petite, but curvy. i recommend this dress if you do not have a lot of boobage. unfortunately, for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits, but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.
685	1	a	I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers - you will also!
686	1	a	Love, love, love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you wo not regret it!
687	1	a	This has quickly become my favorite dress. i bought the turquoise dress and the color is so lovely. the fit is perfect and the lines are flattering and classic. this is one of those dresses that will never go out of style.
688	1	a	Many complements today at work! comfortable even on days you do not want to wear something form fitting
689	1	a	Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.the slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slip.i wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend. looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!
690	1	a	Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big, the xxs are sold out. typical.
691	1	a	Like other reviewers have mentioned, i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body, i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places, and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl, so i was not sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom
692	1	a	I bought this sweater in the navy blue and love it! it soft and not itchy, and the tie back detailing gives it that extra something special. i'm 5'7 and 38 d, waist line 27/28 inches, and the size m is a perfect fit! wore it yesterday to my son 3rd birthday party with jeans and received a lot of compliments.
693	1	a	Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
694	1	a	I purchased this dress in my usual petite size 2. it fit me quite well for the most part, a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress. there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area (i'm small chested). also, the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap (below the bow) which made me think i needed to size up. i'm not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end. the
695	1	a	"I would give this top a 4.5. it is a very pretty top, i love the embroidery, but runs a little short for my taste. it still meets past the top of my pants, but barely. this is why i did not give this top a 5. i am 5'9"" so i think for a petite person the length would be perfect."
696	0	a	Boxy, short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...
697	1	a	I love this long knit skirt! it is great for any of the cooler seasons! it has a lovely somewhat a-line look when you have it on. the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it. true to size. i love the length to pair with tall boots!
698	1	a	I love this top! it falls in a romantic and easy way. it very flattering and looks great. i just had a baby two weeks ago so it hides my insecurities and post baby bump. i had many compliments and felt so comfortable, so ordered it in the green color. i wish there were more!!
699	1	a	"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however, the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!"
700	1	a	I was walking by my local retailer and saw this in the window and loved the colors. it a great combination and looks good with white jeans, and regular denim. i like the cuffs on the sleeves and the textured material. it is a kimono - so in essence it is not form fitting. it meant to flow over whatever else you have on. i purchased the xs/s and i am a normal size 2 and it looks cute. i got lots of compliments when i wore it! there are slits on either side at the bottom hem as well which allow
701	1	a	Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it a 10
702	1	a	I love this! i agree with previous post that say it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.
703	1	a	I washed this on the delicate cycle and air dried - very happy to report that it washed very well and still looks new!
704	1	a	This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which is not necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also ca not see in the picture, but they are not gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i did not find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34
705	1	a	I'm super happy with the way these jeans fit. i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality. this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed. they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great... lots of compliments!
706	1	a	Perfection. effortless cool, and the colors are much more vibrant and gorgeous in person. endless options. you know a sweater must be a dream if you end up buying it when it still 90 degrees outside. runs true to size---the medium fit with room to layer underneath.
707	1	a	I'm not nearly as tall as the model so these hit right just right for flats. i love the fit of the wide leg and found the color matching the photo and the light color cords very soft. i did try the blue color on at a different store and found them a bit short. i'm really pleased with these and the sale on sale certainly helped.
708	1	a	Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.
709	1	a	I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
710	1	a	I purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print. the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual.
711	0	a	Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress, just beware it runs very large.
712	1	a	I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green
713	0	a	This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better, but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.
714	0	a	I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however, when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and did not appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.also, i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
715	1	a	I love this top! super soft fabric and beautiful with jeans. getting ready to retire and will make this a regular in my new wardrobe! thanks retailer for putting it on sale!
716	1	a	"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?"
717	1	a	This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but is not too delicate and it not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back does not show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.
718	1	a	"Cute in concept, so large in reality. i am 5'3"", size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. do not even try if you are a little person. long and lean, yes, would probably look great on you."
719	1	a	I ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces, vests, pins, belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable, pret
720	1	a	I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y
721	0	a	I ordered this dress in coral. while i like it and the dress is nice, i have many other outfits that i like better so this will be going back to the store. i might have kept it in black or blue.
722	1	a	Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!
723	1	a	What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there was not much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.
724	1	a	"I tried the b&w one in the store. liked the look and feel of it. fabric is soft and comfortable. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. this dress runs large. size 0 was too big on me - armhole, waist, length, etc. i'm ordering 0p online, hoping it will fit better. not a huge fan of the black belt, otherwise very happy with the dress."
725	1	a	Great that it hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
726	1	a	I reallllly love this sweater! i could wear it every day if i could. the sweater is comfortable, lightweight (but not see through) and versatile.
727	1	a	Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed.
728	1	a	Bought this today and i'm in love!! very flattering, great fit!
729	1	a	I love this piece ! i purchased it on sale months ago and when i wear it i just love it!! it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices thx retailer!
730	1	a	This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and would not be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!
731	0	a	This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.
732	1	a	"This dress is 100% rayon, not silk like the description says. that does not bother me that much because it a really cute dress! it also hand washable, which i like! i hate going to the dry cleaners! it fits true to size, and i know i will wear it for lots of occasions ? from casual to business. i almost always wear a small in retailer dresses and this one is the same. i'm 5'3"" and the length hits me at the knee, so it might be too short for taller girls. the only other thing that was unexpected"
733	1	a	Love this dress!! i ordered the blue for some color and it is nicer in person than in the photo. the fabric and color are beautiful. can dress this up or wear for work. i am 5', 110 lbs and 35/26/35 and got the size xs petite. it is a loose fit but not too loose. very unique dress that i can wear all fall and winter.
734	1	a	The jumpsuit is very pretty but it definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
735	1	a	I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit, but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think, kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some, but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i do not need to worry about it.just lovely really, love the blue color especially
736	1	a	This dress is more beautiful in person. loved it . fits true to size . i had to return it because it was to long for what i needed.
737	1	a	"This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6"" and the length was just right, abou"
738	1	a	I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
739	1	a	Beautiful and stylish. looks amazing with my new black suede over the knee boots! i am 4-6 on top and curvy 6-8 on bottom so aline skirt is great (interior slip is tight straight skirt rather than a-line, which dropped one star).
740	1	a	I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i ca not wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
741	1	a	This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend
742	1	a	I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they did not have petite anymore, so i bought 27r, knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better, and it fits a tad loose ev
743	1	a	At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i did not wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of
744	1	a	Love my new top! i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants! it funky style garnered lots of compliments. as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate. it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out!
745	1	a	I've gotten so many compliments on this super adorable vest! it soft & comfortable and the fit is very flattering. i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because for $130 i'd expect there to be no loose threads all over the place, but it easy to forget about those when you realize how dang cute it is!
746	1	a	I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms are not tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c
747	1	a	In retailer defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
748	1	a	Love this top, runs true to size. looks cute with in style army green cargo pants. great buy at sale price.
749	1	a	I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!
750	0	a	This vest looked so cute online but it a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring does not work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously, it bad.
751	1	a	This top is flowy and feminine. the pink is slightly more vivid than pictured online but is still a beautiful, soft pink (definitely not red). i was afraid the shape would be unflattering on my not-so-skinny figure but it not. it baggy all over, and there plenty of room in the arms. note that dark pants/skirts will show through the fabric, so i like the shirt better with an untucked cami/tank top underneath it (so the gorgeous neckline is not disturbed but the pink color runs true throughou
752	0	a	"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
753	1	a	I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought
754	0	a	"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off, it is scratchy"", so i did not bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.fit was true to size."
755	1	a	I would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type.
756	1	a	Love this jacket so much! so comfy and great for traveling. i love the fit and the way it wears,
757	1	a	"I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative."
758	1	a	Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.
759	1	a	I just loved this online and love it in person. so feminine and delicate. just perfect for summer get togethers.
760	1	a	This t-shirt does a great job of elevating the basic t-shirt in to one with a touch of flair. i typically wear a medium but luckily read earlier reviews and went with the small.
761	0	a	Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
762	0	a	This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit, however, the sleeves were too long. had to return, as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
763	1	a	I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they do not stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.
764	1	a	"Love, love this dress! the fit is perfect, the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare. there is the perfect amount of swing and it a great length, i ca not say enough about it. i think it worth the price, which i have to admit, i was hesitant about. so comfortable and versatile! i see it being worn quite often!keep dresses like this coming!btw, the neck line is flattering on every body type!for reference, i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 lbs and i purchased a size 2, but i think a"
765	1	a	Loved this dress and was even happier to learn i could order it in petite!!
766	1	a	Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 32 dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca.
767	1	a	I love this unique piece. it is slightly over sized which is intended - cinches allow you to tighten the waist area/providing more definition. will look great with booties in the fall.. great boho dress.. the included slip runs small and short. however, if it a piece you love, you could easily wear a different slip if you wanted something a little longer.
768	1	a	Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders.
769	1	a	"I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas. it does not look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and is not too big or too tight anywhere. i am 5'6"" and 130 and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model. the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit. this is a winner! it can be worn casually or dressed up."
770	1	a	Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric was not polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break!
771	0	a	This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
772	1	a	The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!
773	0	a	"I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy, however, they are way too long. i could not believe these were a 33 inch inseam, but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4"" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i do not think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed."
774	1	a	This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i do not rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.
775	1	a	Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it, glad i purchased it.
776	1	a	I am always looking for a shirt that a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.
777	1	a	I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible! i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare. i get compliments on it every where i go. it flattering, comfy and it a one piece that does not make me feel frumpy. buy this suit!
778	1	a	I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i did not want to risk showing any skin at work. the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find
779	1	a	"Sometimes ""swing"" styles do not work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!! (do not know why they call this coloration ""yellow"". it n"
780	1	a	This is the perfect dress to wear casual or dress up a bit - perfect for fall and super comfy!
781	1	a	I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too...
782	1	a	I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s.
783	1	a	Failed to read website description that vest is polyester shearling-lined.that on me.beware: pockets decorative only.runs a size small due to fact vest is polyester shearling-lined.
784	0	a	This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.
785	1	a	I've been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect! it super soft and comfortable. will look awesome over a dress or with jeans. love it!
786	0	a	Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.
787	1	a	Love the look, beautiful color, great length. but with many of retailer lace skirts, dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate.
788	1	a	I ordered the blue top. it great for the hot summer we're having in the southeast this year.
789	1	a	These jeans fit perfectly. however, the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
790	1	a	Comfortable top. would have been nice to have it a couple inches longer. pretty colors (the floral pattern).
791	0	a	This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
792	1	a	Love this sweater.. fits perfect, flattering and soft. i got it in both colors. it is a true staple!
793	1	a	This top is a keeper. subtle plaid, flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!
794	1	a	I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.
795	1	a	This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.
796	1	a	I tried this on in a m - it fit tts aside from the fact that there were super long. very form fitted and flattering.
797	1	a	Love the versatility of this dress. looks better in person!
798	1	a	This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
799	1	a	Fantastic top! fits, flatters and falls beautifully! i loved the white so much i went back for the black! i wear with jeans, leggings and with pant suits. lovely with all!
800	0	a	It nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
801	1	a	These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!
802	1	a	I wanted to love this top but could not. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction, lace details, 3/4 sleeves.
803	0	a	I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
804	0	a	I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
805	1	a	The torso runs a bit long, but this is otherwise a comfortable, and cute dress.
806	1	a	Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno, she is correct on all counts: pretty colors, quality construction, ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway), oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which
807	0	a	Color is not like photo and fit does not work if you're busty
808	1	a	"Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well! this is my first pair of pants from retailer. i always have the ""too tight in the thighs"" and ""gaping at the waist"" issue but not with these at all. i was so surprised. i purchases size 26 in both tan and blue. the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable. a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway;)"
809	1	a	"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!"
810	1	a	"Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6"" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium."
811	1	a	I like the red color and the border detail at the neckline. i'm not crazy about the way the zipper on the back is emphasized. i'd rather have a less visible zipper. overall it is a cute and comfortable dress. the fabric is soft and substantial and has a nice texture to it. the shape is basic so it can be dressed up or down.
812	1	a	This is a pretty dress, although it runs smaller and the colors are not as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
813	1	a	In the photo, this looks like a heavy knit top, but it not. the fabric is very light, thin, and soft. it like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so, to me, you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.the front criss-crosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement. the two fabric pieces sort of
814	1	a	"I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige - these jeans are different than the regular paige styles, in all the best ways. they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering; the waist is high, so my tush does not hang out when i sit - i love them. i am 5'8"" and 140lbs and these are long. i can only wear them with heels, but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it!"
815	1	a	This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.
816	1	a	I agree with other reviews. this is perfect to throw on for running errands or just hanging out at home. super soft and comfy. got the blue and now want the grey.
817	1	a	This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.
818	0	a	"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms, and waist and hips. it just an enormous tent. i am 5'8"", 128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i ca not think of any body type it would flatter. potentially, women quite far along in their pregnancy."
819	1	a	This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!
820	0	a	This vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful, but the fit is very off. you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs, and made my waist look wide. it also ran small.
821	1	a	I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large, but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.
822	0	a	Looks great from the front, but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
823	1	a	I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.
824	0	a	Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft, cute design but not flattering. returning
825	1	a	Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!
826	1	a	I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it was not too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
827	1	a	These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.
828	0	a	I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!
829	0	a	Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
830	1	a	Super easy date or work dress. it a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.
831	1	a	Look closely and you will be surprised at this awesome print! the shirt is very soft and comfy. be warned that it runs huge. i usually wear a medium or large in this brand. after many tries, i ended up with a small and it is roomy. this looks so cute under a jacket too.
832	1	a	I normally wear a xs, but i got a small so it would be a little longer. great quality and adorable!
833	0	a	I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides i wante
834	1	a	I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i do not have to layer over a tank. also arm holes do not gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers, jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly.
835	1	a	I love this cozy and comfy top. it is oversized as the name says and implies - but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small - and i'm glad i did. it is boxy and oversized - but also short. the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is - and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy.
836	1	a	First of all, the photo online does not really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an
837	1	a	I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on, i really liked the way it looked and felt! it flattering, comfortable and looks great with jeans! it really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
838	1	a	"I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer""s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,"
839	1	a	I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, do not slip in the waist. zero negatives. i ca not wait to wear these bad boys out.
840	1	a	In the photos i have a different tank underneath than the one that comes with the shirt. i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
841	1	a	I love sanctuary clothing. this parka is on the lighter side, good for this mild east coast winter. it is water repellent. the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long ( good for longer limbs). i received many compliments.
842	1	a	This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!
843	1	a	First of all, this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online, i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans, i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist, big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also, there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck
844	1	a	"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops)."
845	1	a	Classic and beautiful style. structured material that will always fall just right. looks beautiful and will take you to any occasion - heels or flats, office or dinner party. definitely shows off your shoulders.
846	1	a	I bought this dress in black with the polka dot pattern, and the style is adorable. i love the empire waist and the fit is very flattering. the v does come down a bit low, but a cami can be work underneath for more coverage. my main complaint is the fabric. it is very thin and wrinkles extremely easily. luckily the dark color hides this, but it a bit disappointing how easily it wrinkles.great style with leggings or tights - really an all-season dress, though. ran very large for me - i purcha
847	0	a	I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all.
848	0	a	I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.
849	1	a	Super cute shirt. really flowy on the bottom - good if you want to hide your middle. great quality material.
850	1	a	Beautiful flattering blouse
851	1	a	This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s
852	0	a	I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and could not wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it was not too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white, which you can plainly see in the picture, but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
853	1	a	I'm going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress, i had to have it! i love it! it soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in! the seams are a bit awkward and that due to the bottom part shape. i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more. a navy blue sash/scarf/ribbon around the waist can do the trick too!
854	0	a	I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick, and the pattern is just ok. did not do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.
855	0	a	Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
856	1	a	Lovely statement shift. sweet and sophisticated at the same time. the lightweight knit drapes nicely over one figure. my store showed it paired with a collared cream-white blouse for alternative styling. i know i'll be experimenting with solid tees.
857	1	a	These are the perfect pants for the hourglass figure, i needed sz 4 but the store was sold out in my sz plan to order . these pants are light weight and fit in all the right spots , do not show any flaws on legs and i do have them ,but they are very complimentary to my figure . they are also really hip without being over the top or weird.
858	1	a	Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please, cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!
859	1	a	I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that was not a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it too nice for a cover up.
860	1	a	"I do not have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28"" and they are very comfortable."
861	1	a	This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!
862	1	a	So soft and comfortable ? i wish i'd bought the other colour too!
863	1	a	The reason i gave this an overall rating of 4 stars is because of the sizing. the jumpsuit runs big and the black does not have a petite option; otherwise, i would give this 5 stars. this jumpsuit is so gorgeous that i had to buy both colors. i bought the black in medium and it looks absolutely beautiful on but i will have to take it to get it altered; it is way too big on me. i really need a petite in this but i still bought the black and am getting it altered. i loved this jumpsuit so much
864	1	a	Just to back up what everyone else is saying, this poncho is perfect. it is indeed super soft! casual and fun. i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured. this poncho is not tight around the neck, yet not lose. it goes right over your head without messing up your hair. i love the sleeves. they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it. a great alternative to a sweater. i ordered the petite xs/s and i'm 5'3. hits right at bum.
865	1	a	"I tried on the xs in store, and loved it. stylist said i need xs petite, but otherwise, it looks great. the cut is flattering, the neckline is a tad higher and almost has a mini cowl. the colors are neutral and would love to wear with a nice pair of dark flared pants. or skinnies. so at 115 lbs, 30dd, i would go with xs petite( i am below 5'2""). fabric is very soft too..."
866	1	a	"Tried this is my normal 4, and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay, especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice, length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7"" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else."
867	1	a	Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i'm normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer.
868	1	a	When i saw this sweater online i honestly did not think it was really anything special. however, when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.
869	1	a	If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite.
870	1	a	This top is cute for fall. it is a gauzy material and so it not too warm . it longer in the back for coverage . fits true to size .
871	1	a	Gorgeous suit - sexy cut on the back but seems to hold you as well. suit runs very small. i wear a 4 in regular clothing. i bought both the small and medium and just exchanged it for a large.
872	1	a	This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.
873	1	a	"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top, but longer in the skirt! yes, please! i purchased the turquoise, which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 136 lbs and ordered a size small."
874	1	a	I wish this fit more to the body, it really does flare out a lot,a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful, so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.fabric is light for summer, so if you are thin, not muscular, perhaps that would look great?
875	1	a	This is the most beautiful bathing suit ive ever owned. it is so unique and comfortable. the fit and everything is just amazing. so happy with this purchase.
876	1	a	I wore this for the first time today and got so many compliments! i'm a personal stylist and went to an event for the company i work for..which means i was in a room filled with stylish people, and i got nothing but compliments about my top. it is so comfy and i did worry at first about the beading and if it was too fragile, but it was fine. i sized down for this top but ca not wait to wear it all fall and winter!
877	1	a	"These beauties offer such sweet respite from low-rise skinny jeans -- hallelujah! absolutely love the high waist and elongated line. i'm 5' 7' and the 25 are a great fit. very slimming, and already i've dressed them down with an off-the-shoulder top and wedge espadrilles and dressed them up with a silk blouse and heels. the design is very retro-fabulous, the quality top notch. love these and look forward to having them as a ""forever"" staple in my denim repertoire. i've been searching far and wid"
878	1	a	"I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash is not as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2"" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash, and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans."
879	1	a	A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they do not stretch out like others i have tried. i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.
880	1	a	For the sale price, this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because, being on sale, that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders, and i did not buy it. when i came back a few days later, i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly do not know my shirt size in numbers, but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it fairly true
881	1	a	"I absolutely loved this the minute i saw it. the quality is impeccable, and the fit is amazing. i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick (back to the quality of this piece, amazing!!) and some women may not like the extra ""bulk"" to that part of the body. however i'm still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it. thank you retailer for always providing unique, quality pieces :)"
882	1	a	"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i do not think it too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic."
883	1	a	I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3, 122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;)
884	1	a	I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i ca not resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can
885	1	a	Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.
886	0	a	"The material, deep color and design are gorgeous. however, the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p, and it just was not flattering on me. it somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise."
887	1	a	This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth
888	1	a	"I really love this pair of fitted cargos. i'm 5""1, 103 pounds and bought a 25p since that what i take in most jeans at retailer. it is quite fitted like it shows on the model so some may prefer to size down for a comfortable fit. i bought the grey color and is a lovely neutral color. love these and may have to go for another color!"
889	1	a	This dress is wonderful! word to the wise, it says that you can machine wash the dress on cold, which i did. the dress came out fine, but the slip is now basically a shirt. there are no washing instructions on the slip, but i assumed it would be the same. it is not. it still looks ok under the top part, but i will have to wear a half slip under the bottom.
890	1	a	Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt! and the color sky is gorgeous! but as another reviewer said--it runs small. it was also way too short. so sadly i will be returning this. i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just did not fit me.
891	0	a	I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
892	1	a	"I love this sweatshirt. it super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra). that said, selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading, at best. i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i ca not imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12. just be real -- this is a smedium. one star removed for the ""one size fits all"" fallacy."
893	1	a	"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and ca not wait to wear it to work!"
894	1	a	This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.
895	1	a	This is the most perfect tunic out there. it is comfy, flattering and fits perfect. it can be dressed up or dressed down. definitely worth it to buy in every color!
896	1	a	Absolutely stunning dress. true to size and flows like a dream.
897	1	a	I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but do not be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th
898	1	a	This is a very comfortable dress. i absolutely love the design, the feel (structured and has weight), and the 3/4 sleeves. perfect dress for brunch and work. the fit is not giving in the chest area. i needed to go up a size due to the inflexibility of the material; even tried it without a bra.... nope, was not a happening. i ordered a size up and love it!the only con are the buttons. they are very thin and not a good choice for the heavy fabric. broke one in the fitting room!
899	1	a	Super cute and comfy, perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.
900	1	a	I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it did not deter my liking it because it still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so
901	1	a	I absolutely love this sweater. it is a great quality sweater dress and a beautiful color. so comfy and warm too. i never want to take it off. definitely one of my favorite purchases from retailer.
902	1	a	I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress, but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer, it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful.
903	1	a	Very pleased with this top. i got the blue and white first and now i'm getting the red and white. the material is comfy and not sheer, and the slits at the side and the zipper in back add extra style.
904	1	a	Agree with other reviewers that the sweater might swallow you up unless you are tall. it soft (not itchy), well made, comfy and stylish. i want it to get cold out so i can wear it!
905	1	a	When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i do not think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh
906	1	a	"I bought these in the blue. i sized down, as other reviewers mentioned, going for an xs. i'm 5'5"" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5"" the length was too long for me, hitting me below my ankles, rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then, i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly, they hung a little funny on me, rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price, these went back!"
907	1	a	"As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big ""thank you"" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i do not want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3"" ordered size"
908	1	a	This pullover is a great purchase. the color is simply stunning and is very comfortable.
909	1	a	More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too.
910	0	a	This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!
911	1	a	Likes: colors, the design of the flower is very pretty, the color-blocking is a nice touch and in this season, but, it is pretty short.i bought thh petite right off the bat as i assumed i would need that, but i really dind't. it ended up beign too short.#/4 sleeves always flattering, but hte cut is meant to be comfy, i think it would have looked better on me if it was a little more hourglass hsaped (if that makes sense#.i am usually xs, and that was fine, so buy your usual size ok #one siz
912	0	a	I wore this blazer for one day, did not do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it completely unfixable, since it not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it good over something cute.or, it would be, if it did not fall apart.
913	1	a	From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.
914	1	a	"Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable. fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open. but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new ""action shots"" show. i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress. i'm 5'3"" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length."
915	1	a	I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on, i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8, but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger, so unless you have really broad shoulders, you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place, and the little tie in the front is awesome, because not only is it an interesting detail, it can be loosened or tightened d
916	1	a	"I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, ""wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?"" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress does not seem like much - it not even lined. but it comfy, flattering (in all the right pla"
917	1	a	Ok. so this coat is amazing! it high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try
918	1	a	When i first tried it on, i was worried it would add 10-15 lbs to my hourglass frame, but if worn correctly, it actually has a flattering, slimming effect. i recommend wearing it open (like in the photo) with the same type of outfit underneath...looks very chic! or, to give yourself a defined waist, use the provided ribbon belt tied to the side or use your own large, statement belt. also looks great with vintage sunglasses! the fabric quality ca not be beat. it nice and heavy to the touch. i ca
919	1	a	"These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8"" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i did not get two pair."
920	1	a	"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!"
921	1	a	"Really cute casual dress. wore it to a ""girls night"" out!! they all loved it. ca not wait to wear it again with knee high boots!"
922	1	a	This dress set my heart a-flutter, but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes, and when i put them on, they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v
923	0	a	After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that did not fit right.
924	1	a	This is a vary cute blouse. i ordered both colors in my typical medium, intending to give one to my sister. i could not decide what color to keep but went with the black simply because it fit my style better. looks great with dark jeans. the tan stripe is very cute, a little more summery and looked better on the sis than me.
925	1	a	I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it such a comfy yet sexy top!
926	1	a	Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time), i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and would not arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.
927	1	a	I ordered the red/navy and i love that its a true red and navy. the subtle ribbing adds the right amount of texture. i normally order size small but i felt the top was a little big and has a very long hem line. i'm hoping it shrinks in the wash and i might alter the hem if its still too long after washing.
928	1	a	A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!
929	1	a	I love this sweater! the wool is soft and not itchy. it can be worn tied in the front as shown or tied in the back. pretty embrodering and very flattering.
930	1	a	I loved this but did not realize it has mohair which agitated my contacts. i had to return it. if you do not have that problem, this goes great with leggings or jeans.
931	1	a	"This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will ""draw up"" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t"
932	1	a	Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size, they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.
933	0	a	"Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no, no, no!"
934	1	a	Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.
935	1	a	This is a beautiful shirt. like many other reviewers stated, this shirt does not have a lining. but any white camisole works just fine. love it! i've already gotten tons of compliments.
936	1	a	"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust."
937	1	a	I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all, the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dﾃ｣ﾂｩcolletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me
938	1	a	One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i do not know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede
939	1	a	I love this tunic, the detail the weight, the fringe. but it runs big. i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller. i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium.
940	1	a	These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure
941	1	a	I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared. hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance. i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate. length mid-knee. imo not worth full price. eleveness does design pretty coats!
942	1	a	"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh, that the one!"" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress."
943	1	a	The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!
944	1	a	In nature pilco fashion, these jeans are amazing. i wear them rolled down, they have a slight boot cut, but not overly. i am 5'10 and the bottoms fall right to my heel- meaning the hem does not drag on the ground-finally the perfect pair of jeans. they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day! highly recommend, although a little pricy for pilcro, worth the splurge.
945	1	a	Oh my this is the best cardigan ever. quality is superb and so soft. i am between a 12 and 14 so i ordered the xl, this cardigan fits true to size. will order more if more colors become available.
946	1	a	I bought one size up in these fun cropped pants. i am petite but wanted these to fit longer, so i ordered a regular size. they are perfect. there is a nice patterned texture to these pants that is hard to see in the pictures. they are worth the price!
947	0	a	"I so wanted to love this tank, and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i was not even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model, but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it, but it just ca not work on me!"
948	1	a	I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit
949	1	a	"I love love love these white jeans. the crop style is great as i am 5'1"", so the fit is perfect for an ankle jean.these fit the bill in every way. they are so comfy!"
950	1	a	Soft very forgiving and flattering top, wish it was not so pricey
951	0	a	This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person, the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also do not show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft, though. returned it!
952	0	a	Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.
953	1	a	"Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29"" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27"", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip.i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser ""slip"" with them to prolong the need for cleaning"
954	1	a	"The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors. this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details. it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown. i do not think it is too thin and i wo not need to add a camisole. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120 and i got a small. perfect."
955	1	a	I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha
956	1	a	Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.
957	0	a	Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
958	0	a	This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
959	1	a	Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.
960	0	a	Ugh. i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off. this dress is adorable. unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls. otherwise the fit was perfect. very disappointed in the top of this dress.
961	0	a	This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty, but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work, but it was just so impractical.
962	1	a	This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just did not work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just did not work. had to send it back.
963	1	a	I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!
964	0	a	Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown. however this is a thin cashmere for the price. returned.
965	1	a	This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.
966	1	a	Pretty, easy-to-wear dress. loose fitting. i am typically a size 4, size 4 fit, but i might have been able to go to a size 2 if i wanted it to be more fitted at the chest/arms.
967	0	a	Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on, which is a first. was very cute in theory, but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
968	1	a	This coat is super cute and flattering. i am 5&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;8&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; and it comes almost to my knee on the back. i&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;m usually a small but got the medium in case i wear a bulky sweater underneath. comfy and warm, but won&amp;amp;amp;#39;t be warm enough when winter hits without a big sweater underneath. great to throw on to walk the dog or hit the bus stop in style.
969	1	a	When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that
970	1	a	"The fabric is so thin, i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky, it cotton-ey, and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....however, i'm such a sucker for a pre"
971	1	a	If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it is not just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.
972	0	a	I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
973	1	a	"Little clack dress. classic shape but is pretty low in the v neck. i am busty (34dd) and need a ""push-up"" bra to make the neckline close. it very easy to wear and super comfy."
974	1	a	These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and did not flatter my shape at all.however, very nice jean once again from pilcro.
975	1	a	I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back did not fall too long. it runs true to size. it soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it fine.
976	1	a	Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big. i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down. fit ty in legs and bottom. love color!
977	1	a	I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!
978	0	a	I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i could not return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it disappointing.
979	1	a	I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere
980	1	a	"This is an awesome blouse! it is well made. the fabric is thick and soft. it drapes beautifully. i love the tie at the top. i wish it came in other colors - other than the denim offered. i am 5'4"", 115 pounds, flat chested. the xs fit well."
981	1	a	"For the price, you ca not beat this dress. i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it - if you're a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts (like the tearoom pencil skirt), you will love this! for me, it the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it. it a perfect length (above the knee on 5""7""...similar to the model), armholes are the right size, and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering, even post-baby. super happy with the value"
982	0	a	This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.
983	1	a	Conceptually, this top is great. love the design and the bright crisp color and most of all the cut outs. the material is a little stiff but can see it softening up a bit with a wash or two. it does run very small. i am 145 pounds, 5'6: with a full 34c bust and a curvy hourglass figure 34, 28, 41. while it fits everywhere else, the bust is really small. i wear a size 6 but had to go up to a size 10. the size 8 fit but the chest would only close without a bra. so, i had to go up 2 sizes.. so when
984	1	a	I was thinking this would be a straight up terry cloth athleisure top, but the subtle metallic thread woven into the cloud gray fabric elevates the style. really loved the top because of the cut and interesting hemline, but i adore it for the bit of sparkle.
985	1	a	This coat looks great, but the fabric is thin--only partly wool. the snaps also don&amp;amp;#39;t stay shut very well; i&amp;amp;#39;ll probably add a hook-and-eye closure for security. despite its flaws, it looks good enough that it&amp;amp;#39;s a keeper (when purchased on-sale).
986	0	a	This is really cute online, but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder, but the material is very thin, and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of.
987	1	a	The color is just beautiful. i've gotten so many compliments!
988	1	a	I bought the orange color and the pattern is absolutely beautiful. the fabric and style is very flattering and comfortable. well worth it. runs true to size (i am usually an xsmall 134 lbs 34 c and the xsmall fit perfect). perfect summer dress: soft fabric and light.
989	0	a	"Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it did not really feel ""brand new"" when it arrived"
990	1	a	I like the idea of a skort, and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i ca not wait for warmer weather to wear it!
991	1	a	My husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift. these leggings, let me tell you about these leggings!! so comfortable, so cute (buttons/color/pattern), love they way they feel on my legs. as soon as i get home from work i put them on (well, a lot of days). i am ordering another pair. i am someone who does not do leggings. i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy, that how much i love them.
992	0	a	I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it basically cut for model-sized people only. it short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i ca not imagine this will look good on most women.
993	1	a	I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral, just beautiful!
994	1	a	I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottomi am 5'8, typically wear a size 12, and it was true to size for methe
995	1	a	This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.
996	1	a	I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it definitely a keeper.
997	0	a	It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. would not recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
998	0	a	Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.
999	1	a	I thought i'd be the exception - these pants are super cute - great fabric and color - kind of loved them - but they do run small - by about one size. just something to keep in mind while ordering. other than that - they are lovely, well-made pants.
1000	1	a	This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves (but the rest of the shirt fit well) pretty pretty blouse. hides bulges, runs a little long. super soft material. a must have for fall!!!
1001	1	a	High quality, great color, loved the neckline. unfortunately a little too snug on me so it showed my bulges on waist and back. not too snug if you do not have that problem. i loved this shirt but had to return it.
1002	0	a	Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
1003	0	a	The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.
1004	1	a	Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on
1005	1	a	I'm 5'3 135lbs with hour-glassy figure and the medium was a too tight from the waste down (but perfect on the top - i'm a 36c). pretty dress overall and looks true to color in photo, but have to return.
1006	1	a	"I was not going to even try to see it this dress would fit. it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model. i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it! my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals. there a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out. i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
1007	1	a	This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.
1008	0	a	I wanted to love this. however, the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.
1009	0	a	The design is cute, but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also, the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron, you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
1010	0	a	I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just did not work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me.
1011	1	a	This swing dress is very cute and easy to wear. i ordered the orange print and the black because i could not decide. the orange looked washed out against my skin color but the black was a keeper. i am usually a small but ordered one in the small and one in the extra small since it is a swing dress and they usually run large. the top is mostly the same fit so i think i may keep the extra small. even still there is a lot of extra fabric. the rayon is a little on the cheap side but it is so comforta
1012	1	a	Very long shirt, i have to tuck it in. i love the lipstick design and its great quality material. its really soft and cotton breathable.
1013	1	a	I really love this dress, just not on me! i am very curvy, with a rounder stomach. i normally wear a 10 (5'8, 160lbs), and the 10 fit, but it is so fitted that i did not like how it showed everything. if i had a flatter stomach, i would have kept it, but it just does not work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down (it was riding up a bit). the fabric is great, the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway (my boyfriend, who is picky,
1014	1	a	"Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7"", 127, and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase."
1015	0	a	Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
1016	1	a	I love, love, love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
1017	1	a	I bought the extra small and although i love the style and unique color combo, it pretty large in the collar area and without the right blouse/shirt underneath it makes my neck look really skinny. the rest of the coat is true to size, longer and straight. the design just does not have the right balance for me so i'm sending it back.
1018	1	a	What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.
1019	0	a	This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else, but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress, this will be a hard dress to wear.the color is really lovely though!
1020	0	a	I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.
1021	1	a	First of all a caveat, i am not curvy at all. i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such. specifically, i am 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 123 pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style. all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dresses/clothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such. if you are shaped like me, this dress will be perfect for you! it highlights your advantages (slim and petite) and give you curves (that i wish i had natural
1022	1	a	This top looks great and feels great. got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving. i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up.
1023	1	a	One of the most beautiful sweaters i've ever seen. i love it!
1024	1	a	This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,
1025	1	a	Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+
1026	0	a	I was disappointed in this vest, it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big, does not drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering, looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair!
1027	1	a	I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i have not completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size
1028	1	a	"This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove, very flattering.& got lots of compliments.i am 5'4"" and 125 lbs, i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)"
1029	1	a	This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it does not overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w
1030	1	a	It hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size, i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.
1031	1	a	I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i have not laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.
1032	0	a	I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.3. in the picture, t
1033	1	a	This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women, like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small, but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color, great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.
1034	1	a	My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.
1035	1	a	These look great on my wife. very versatile and go with like 80% of her wardrobe. she raves about them and they look great.
1036	1	a	This shirt is more beautiful in person. it has a lovely hand feel (soft) and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant. i bought it for my 13 year old niece. she loved it! she may have to return for a small, but i do feel the size ran true to size. it depends on how you want to wear it.
1037	1	a	I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.
1038	0	a	The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.
1039	1	a	"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have."
1040	1	a	I really like this dress, i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big (i guess ti is the style). i love the eyelet design, the high low is very flattering, and the neckline too. very comfortable. i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering, but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger size.nice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs!(115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)
1041	0	a	"The fabric and color of this dress is beautiful. two problems with the dress that the picture does not show. 1. it long. i'm 5'5"". this model must be over 6 feet tall as the length hit 5 inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length. the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy. i'm 42 and the puffiness reminded me of prom. color and fabric great. but had to send back."
1042	0	a	I originally bought this dress in the store. however, it ended being a size too big. so, i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived, i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may
1043	0	a	The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it getting returned.
1044	1	a	This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it true to size, size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like
1045	1	a	I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.
1046	1	a	I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it not - the pockets are cut bad, it cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)
1047	1	a	"Trying the gray version on in the store, i found that the size of the armholes varied greatly within the same size. i am a 32c, 5'6"", 120 lbs. bought the size s. the top looks great with a faded denim skirt and is also appropriate for office environment. i also ordered the ivory in a s, but again, the armholes were so large that i had to return it. if you decide to try this top, order it in multiples of two sizes to find one that fits your arms."
1048	1	a	This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i ca not wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!
1049	1	a	Flattering cut, the tie neck is very nice, but definitely needed the petite for me, regualr size went too low. the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy, with a bit of texture in ti, not sure it is obvious from the picture. length in eptite went right below my knee, but in a goood spot. overall, loved it, but returned in hopes it hits sales one day (jsut spending too much latetly)...
1050	1	a	I fell in love with this dress the second i saw it in store. i have not experienced any of the issues others have. i love the short, flowy, feminine look and i think it can be dressed up or down. it would be great for a summer wedding or cocktail event, or dressed down as a day dress with a jean jacket. i've received compliments every time i've worn it.
1051	1	a	I have worn this dress with a jean jacket, birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal. it washes beautifully and is super soft. would buy in different colors if there were more options. looks better in person.
1052	1	a	The picture online does not do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that do not make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
1053	1	a	"I bought these in white (not a harsh white, more soft-looking), and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size), which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5"" tall, weigh 135 pounds, and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized, so there some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels, they're perfect. they look as pictured, but what you ca not tell from the photo i"
1054	1	a	Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it soft!
1055	1	a	This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions do not look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.
1056	1	a	Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i had not found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.please bring this style back!
1057	1	a	"This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2"", 102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!"
1058	1	a	I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but does not look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.
1059	0	a	I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i do not think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....
1060	0	a	Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
1061	1	a	Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you do not need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a
1062	1	a	This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves, love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted, body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.
1063	1	a	Super soft and comfy, with stylish look
1064	1	a	Fun top, 5'4, 135 lbs and i ordered xs. it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great. i like the fun slant to the side. not tight on stomach which is great! :) great top.
1065	1	a	Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but do not you dare lift your arms. i'm kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe?
1066	0	a	I was so excited to get this dress, and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model, but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be, and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long, and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p, and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist
1067	1	a	While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
1068	1	a	Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.
1069	1	a	The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice. the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers. would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress!
1070	1	a	My stylist did not love them... they are well made, the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty. the hem is loose-fitting, perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering... the material is airy, nice for summer, i think you should give these a try,,, for me, perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate.
1071	0	a	I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it, i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however, the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.
1072	1	a	Just as described by others. soft, great fabric and so comfy.
1073	1	a	I thought the design was adorable. i ordered up bc of reviews and i am glad i did. i am a size 6 so i ordered a size 8. the upsize is needed so u can get into the top part of the romper. otherwise it would be mission impossible. it a pain to get on and off as all rompers are but it soo cute it worth it. had compliments on it the first day i wore it.
1074	1	a	"This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6"", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the ""boxy"" side. i can see that if you do not size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be"
1075	1	a	Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!
1076	0	a	Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn
1077	1	a	"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house, because the legs are very wide.. yes, the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned, but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes do not take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants."
1078	0	a	I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it was not long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.
1079	1	a	Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.
1080	1	a	I ca not wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic. it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it.
1081	0	a	Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i would not have expected b
1082	1	a	Love the pattern. the pants are really cute! perfect for pajamas or casual outfit to go to a fiends house in. they do have a funny seam above the knee but i still find them comfortable
1083	1	a	This is already sold out in petites and the reason for this is asymmetrical stripes: this is the most flattering design for tops. horizontal stripes only look good on people trying to look bigger and heavier. do you know anyone like that, b/c i do not! vertical stripes, while slimming, generally look a little severe, modern, weird (occasionally great), while asymmetrical stripes knock 5lbs off a person. stock more asymmetrical striped tops, please!
1084	1	a	These pants are so comfortable and cute!! you can dress them up or down!
1085	1	a	Love this brand and i keep coming back. i do not have the most tone tush, but maaji always gives a cute little lift. i order a size up (usually a small so i order a medium).
1086	1	a	I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.
1087	1	a	"Bought this in store at full price: it that pretty. black & white, embroidery, pintucks! throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy. my only prob was i had to buy a little large - size 8- as size 6 was already sold out. i am 5' 5"" , 130 lbs."
1088	0	a	"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"
1089	1	a	Great style and fit. will look great with jeans, skirt or leggings!
1090	1	a	Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.
1091	1	a	"It navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i could not use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5""11"", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i did not keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair"
1092	1	a	I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal, ha. i ca not wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol
1093	0	a	I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.at first glance, i knew i would not be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
1094	1	a	This is a really cute skirt, and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also, the zipper does not lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
1095	1	a	I just received these pants and i am very pleased. they are a little longer than i expected them to be, but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office.
1096	1	a	Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !it caught my eye right away in the store.perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.
1097	0	a	Gorgeous design, but it was just so heavy. i felt overwhelmed by the amount of fabric, although this is my fault for thinking i could get by in regular sizing as petite was sold out. will be returning
1098	1	a	I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.
1099	1	a	Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it very flattering. overall a great little dress!
1100	0	a	"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes."
1101	0	a	"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine, and would be a great causal layering piece. however, there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam, and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention, unless you're built very narrow, the pockets will fall at, and accentuate hips, and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit, the layered style, with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay"
1102	0	a	I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i did not pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
1103	0	a	Okay i'm short, so this tent dress is seriously huge on me and not flattering. the fabric is so pretty, but this dress must be for a tall girl. no shape at all!
1104	1	a	I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go.i love the sleeves on this short-sleeved version. i'm fairly fit but at my age i'm not excited about showing off my arms! the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels, bootees or flats with it. i bought the red. sometimes you ca not tell if the c
1105	1	a	This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this was not an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i do not feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.
1106	0	a	I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point. i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!
1107	1	a	This is my third dress by this designer. i love his work. this will be the most versatile and classic of the three.i love how wearing his dresses makes me feel... my best and comfortable. unique and well made.
1108	1	a	This top runs a bit small, but it very pretty. i got the ivory and it beautiful, very form fitting. it is a bit see thru so i will probably wear a tank under it. it simple tshirt material, so i feel like it should be a bit less $.
1109	1	a	"The neutral color was at my local retailer, which is a rich brown/mocha, much nicer looking in person. like others, this is quite sheer and thin. however, it is so stretchy, breathable, and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead. for my 5'9"", 36c, hourglass frame, i found the medium to be rather body hugging. it was not at all loose like on the model. for me, this is fine because i will layer, eliminating issues of sheerness."
1110	1	a	It a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.
1111	1	a	I saw this coat online and loved it. the blue collar is great. the length is great, fits over bottom. it is quite warm. the arms are a little tight but they loosen up. the sale price plus 40% off was the ticket.
1112	1	a	I purchased the one marked with the red dot (the one with the larger pattern and orange in it). i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived. i fell absolutely in love with it immediately. i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and it perfect. very bohemian, which i adore. first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top. it can also be worn the way it is shown. i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket, as show
1113	1	a	I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.
1114	1	a	I love the dress overall, however, found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall, a beautiful dress to own.
1115	0	a	I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.
1116	0	a	This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.
1117	1	a	I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.
1118	1	a	"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit"
1119	0	a	I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.
1120	1	a	"I ordered my typical 6 petite and found that the buttons were pulling at the bust ( i'm 34 b) and at the waist. i'm returning and ordering a size 8 petite because i'm a sucker for a shirtdress and a cute novelty print. the quality is nice and the length was perfect for my short 4""11 frame, now only to wait for it to be shipped! oh how i wish petites were available in my local store!"
1121	1	a	Love the overall design especially the tie on the back. i know it will become a favorite. i do wish it were a tad longer though.
1122	0	a	This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit, but not as a layering piece.
1123	1	a	I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
1124	1	a	It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.
1125	1	a	This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.
1126	0	a	So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.
1127	0	a	Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
1128	1	a	I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more! fabulous quality, material and style. can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts. wear alone or layer. do not miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!
1129	1	a	Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer, but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con, i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason.
1130	1	a	Oh how i love this dress! i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric, it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers. it fits like a dream...true to size...romantic and flirty...i can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandals...the possibilities are limitless. i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out. just love it! i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket. it is a winter whit
1131	1	a	I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming
1132	1	a	I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i was not sure the color would work on my pale skin, but wow, so pretty! it fits like s glove, in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes. the tie waist in a beautiful addition. the chest seems roomy enough, i am a 30 dd and the 0 petite fit. it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested. the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time. my only complaint is the side zipper i
1133	1	a	I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos, but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it super soft and well made. it also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay, but this is a piece that will stay in your closet, and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre
1134	0	a	I loved this romper so much! the material is thin, but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy, like on the model, to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.
1135	1	a	I vacillate betwixt saying this shirt runs large and small. i usually wear a small in retailer items, but the xs was all that was left in the charming bee print. the fit is flattering even though it smaller than my usual size. conclusion: runs large. however, when i went to put my head through the top of the shirt, it was like being birthed. conclusion: runs small. bottom line: i'm in love with this shirt and so i'll just have to get used to the faux birthing feeling every time i put it o
1136	0	a	This is not a kimono. it a cocoon. there a huge difference.it also not made very well.
1137	0	a	These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i'd give it a try, but i did not think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b
1138	1	a	I agree with previous review...looks so much better in person than online! i really do not need another poncho style sweater, but i could not resist. they colors and style are great!
1139	1	a	This is a very cute dress that i did not keep. mainly because i did not like the neckline on me. if it had been different i probably would have kept it. i liked the fabric, the top is a little thin, but i did not think it was sheer. the bottom part is sheer, but there is a lining. it drapes beautifully. it is a little like a maternity dress, but not enough to dissuade me.
1140	0	a	This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.
1141	1	a	The fabric of these pants is not like regular denim, rather it soft and velvety in texture more like a chino. i love the dark saturated olive green. the pocket placement is very flattering on the rear. normally i wear a size 31 in premium denim and size 30 in paige jimmy jimmy jeans, however in this particular pair i needed a size 29. i definitely recommend sizing down!
1142	1	a	These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!
1143	1	a	I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while, and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves, worn long, are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace is not exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used, but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th
1144	0	a	"I was so excited to try these, it hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they do not look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee."
1145	0	a	I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.i ordered size petite xxs
1146	1	a	Beautiful dress. the printed material under the tulle however hung 3 inches lower than the tulle skirt. i had to take it to the cleaners and have it hemmed to match the length of tulle skirt because it looked awkward. even after paying full price for the dress i did not mind spending the extra money to have it hemmed because the dress is that beautiful.
1147	1	a	"I'm not sure why they call this ""black"" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)___________pros:- drapes beautifully on the body, especially for curvier gals.- not black but a deep navy/velvet look and feel.- very forgiving and stretchy.- perfect length in front and back.- hides imperfections wonderfully.- soft, flows well, and unique!cons:- material is thin, not for winter a"
1148	1	a	Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable.
1149	0	a	I wanted to love this dress. sadly, the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats did not help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted.
1150	1	a	"I like this dress because it has a 60 vibe. however, if this swing style is too long, it just looks dowdy. this dress was too long, so i shortened and redeemed mine. i am 5'3 1/2"" and 120 lbs. this style looks best on me just above the kneecap. if you try it on and hate it, it probably because it too long. in the winter i wear this with a long sweater (knee length) with a waistband in it to give it shape and with boots. the dress is lined but it is very, very sheer and requires a slip. or,"
1151	1	a	I have featured two pictures below. one is size s. the other is xs petite. i'm 5 feet 120 and a 34 d. i highly recommend this dress. i definitely could have gone either way. but felt sizing down would be more flattering.
1152	1	a	I was not sure the color would be good on me (pale with reddish hair) but it is great for my complexion. on to the fit...it fits small, imo. i'm a 10, sometimes 8. i got the 10 and it is very form fitting. do not get me wrong, it does a great job of holding it all in and giving a great overall silhouette. but, it not that comfy to sit in and i have to suck in to have a flat belly in it. trying to decide if i should send back and try a 12??
1153	1	a	Very cute but a little short. currently pregnant so i'm hoping it will hang better in a few months
1154	1	a	Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.
1155	1	a	Nice length in tall. order up one size: cut slim in body. fabric lightweight bordering on flimsy.
1156	1	a	I cannot give this dress enough praise!! i say it runs a little large because i'm normally an 8 but the 6 was just more flattering. i wore it for a wedding and i was showered with compliment after compliment about the dress! i've never felt more beautiful, and wish i could have one in every color! and quality? absolutely amazing.
1157	0	a	I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
1158	0	a	Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
1159	1	a	This is a lovely blouse. it has an empire waist type cut, which camouflages tummy and hips nicely (especially after a large holiday meal!). i'm usually between a small and medium (4-6) and did not really notice much of a different between the two sizes.**note: it does not come with the camisole shown in the photo, but any black or white standard camisole would work.
1160	1	a	"I purchased this jacket in a pxs, as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight, which is perfect for living in southern california. i do not feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips. there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem, which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed, giving it a comfy sweater feel. there also two zippered pockets, whic"
1161	1	a	I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.
1162	1	a	I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on. i am usually an 8, but purchased the 6 in this dress. i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the 6 provided. you can decide which look you prefer. both looked good. i just wanted a less baggy look. as one reviewer mentioned, the print is cut different on all of the dresses. i think the colors pictured online are accurate. regarding the snake on the fabric, i have several snakes on my dress, but not on the back a
1163	1	a	Fits true to size, soft material and unique look. the sleeves and overall cut of this shirt are flattering. i was worried it might look boxy or baggy but it did not at all. the dark gray is a gorgeous color and can be dressed up or down. definitely going to be a staple in my closet.
1164	1	a	Most of my jeans are ag. love the ankle length and wash on these. not too distressed either. tts. really soft denim! size 27 like my other ag
1165	1	a	I saw someone try this on when it was 40% off sale, and should ahve purcahsed it then... ended up going back today for it. it is very soft, adn flattering. also, i purchased the balck, this can go with pretty much anything: jeans, skirts, dresses, you name it - very neutral and flattering fit. nto sure if petite would have worked but too late anyway.
1166	1	a	Beautiful dress! love the colors and fit. can be dressed up or down. the only negative is that the buttons fall off. this is my third dress and it too lost a button the first time i wore it. i do not live near an retailer store so i will be keeping it anyways, as this is already my third dress :( my advice would be to reinforce the three buttons as soon as you buy it. there is one at the top, front of the dress and one on each sleeve.
1167	1	a	I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy, but made extremely well and on sale a great price!
1168	1	a	Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
1169	1	a	I love these jeans. they are flattering and do not sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.
1170	1	a	When i saw this i had to have it! i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size (normally a l for the bust) but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest. it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress. so many compliments each time i wear it!
1171	1	a	Subtly chic raincoat, with a lovely drape (except see below) and wonderful details like the large diagonal-opening pockets, snaps, and decorative cord. the striped lining throughout is a cozy but light jersey layer. the coat would be ample cover for temps in the high fifties or low sixties.problems: the double zipper was hard to use, but in my experience with other jackets, you get the hang of a wonky zipper eventually.there seemed to be a problem with a seam by the left pocket so that m
1172	1	a	I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but does not get in the way. it great for casual or casual work wear.
1173	0	a	"I was so disappointed in this top. the fabric blend was too thick for summer. the cut was wide across the shoulders, and very narrow and short through the waist. add in the odd splashes in the print, and it spelled disaster.size: i tend to run between small and xs. i ordered xs. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, narrow across shoulders, with short arms and long torso.fit: the cut was so wide across my narrow shoulders that it looked baggy and felt odd. however, the sleeves did not sl"
1174	1	a	This is a darling white top. the juxtaposition of the simple front and the beautiful lace back makes this a unique piece. definitely size down.
1175	1	a	This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an
1176	0	a	"Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it ca not be fixed."
1177	1	a	The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect. i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure. i am somewhere between a 6 and 8 and the 6 fit perfectly. it can also be strapless which is a sexier version.
1178	1	a	This was returned in store in an xs. i tried it on and it fit. shorter so it was probably meant to be a mini. i will hold on to it for now. on sale so worth the price. colors are nice and bright
1179	0	a	As soon as you get up close to this sweater, you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it was not for me at all even thou
1180	1	a	I ordered two colors and was happy with them both. i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer. i like a layered look, and having layers to peel as needed. these tops are great on their own as well! i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length. really love the fabric too!
1181	1	a	Love these jeans!!! they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles. their first wear was like i'd been wearing them for years. i paired them with the pintuck button-down tunic.
1182	1	a	This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!
1183	1	a	Thus sweater is perfect. the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews. it is super soft and not at all itchy. i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress. the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus. i have not dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink. i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price.
1184	1	a	Love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure, love the colors anything goes with it, and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town
1185	1	a	I've been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that i've ever loved so much! the style is edgy and modern, yet still feminine and flattering. love the cut of the jacket, so flattering! looks amazing with dresses, skirts or denim. i got the dark red color, and it much more brown and neutral than it appears online. i would love to get the tan color as well, but it currently sold out in my size. the faux leather looks believable and expensiv
1186	1	a	I saw this dress online this morning, went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest, but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts, and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest, and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!
1187	1	a	This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.
1188	1	a	These run small in the thighs and behind just like most of the other cartonnier pants. i have four pair of cartonnier pants that are all size 10...which is a size or two up from my usual 6 or 8 in other styles. print is great! fabric is super lightweight and great for summer.
1189	1	a	This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
1190	0	a	I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky. i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places. i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large). i wish this were just a little bit a-line. instead, it literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
1191	1	a	I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer, the length was not awkward and kept it from being to
1192	1	a	My store had only one of these, in a size xs (i tend to be more of a s in most retailer items). it was roomy. i am 5'2, 34d, & figured a petite small would be a perfect fit. i ordered the ps, it arrived today, & is still pretty big! the sleeves (which are quite flared) are a little shorter, as is the overall length, than the regular xs, but overall the ps feels just as big, if not bigger, than the regular xs! trying to decide if i should go back for the regular xs or order the regular xxs.
1193	1	a	More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it, on the front, the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material. not a travel top as it would wrinkle. the pattern and colors are the same as pictured. the sizing is large - i ordered an xs; my size is usually a small. it is a generous fit and boxy, not shaped at all. the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effect.the back (which is all black and is tee shirt fabric)
1194	1	a	A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size 4 was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well, the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy, & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the 4 did not). i went w/ the siz
1195	1	a	I loved the design of these pants, and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there is not enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up, as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.
1196	1	a	Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short
1197	1	a	"I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted did not suit me. i was shocked by how flattering it was, because on the hanger it was just ""meh"". the material is soft jersey, heathered, and it hangs well. it has a simple lining, but that does not interfere with the fit. it is a little low for my personal taste, so i wear a cami or scarf, but for those less well endowed, you'd probably be fine without one. for the record, i typically wear a 2-4, 125 pounds, 5'8, and 32 ddd br"
1198	1	a	Just not the right color for my skin tone (though lovely pink). i did not see the green in person, but probably nice too.the cut is well fitted at the waist, elastic band. i will say, however, that it was almost hard to pull the shoulders over (does not unbutton past waist). fabric is soft and flowey, length on the regular was mid-though for me, i am a tad oder, so it was nice... if i were younger, i would get petite.for reference: 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 inch waist
1199	1	a	"This top is lovely! i wanted so badly to make it work for me, but it is just too short and makes me look broad. i am 5' 11"" and have a long torso, and the keyhole where the tie is gapes (fixed that with two safety pins, though - and would have stitched it shut if i was keeping this lovely blouse).the fact that i cannot lift my arms up without flashing my tummy to the world did not even deter me enough to return it.but the overall fit was just boxy on me. it made me look larger overall. fo"
1200	1	a	Super soft and stylish. it a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on
1201	1	a	Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it does not. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.
1202	1	a	I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell
1203	1	a	"I ca not think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7"" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!"
1204	1	a	Love this top, wore it for the first time today and it looks so good. soooo flattering from the front. the back is plain, but ive got some back fat, so i wear a jacket.
1205	1	a	Great tee! color is vibrant, material is soft, fits great.
1206	0	a	I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just did not work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside
1207	1	a	"I really love this piece. it so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist."
1208	1	a	I did like this coat, however the material was just not what i expected. i was hoping for more of a traditional wool material, but this had a fuzziness to it. not fitted in the waist either, which might just be the style but not what i was hoping for.
1209	0	a	When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight, too boxy.
1210	0	a	This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.
1211	1	a	I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its perfect for out to dinner.
1212	1	a	"I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt. it is a beautiful color! i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it. my husband said he loved the color and style. i wear either a s or m in retailer tops, depending on the brand. with this one i chose a small and it fits perfectly. i have a petite frame; 5'2"", 123 lbs., but with a 32f bust. it is very flattering, as with most off the shoulder tops. they say your shoulders never age :) the length is just right"
1213	1	a	I love this dress! i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me. i did not encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated.
1214	0	a	What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
1215	1	a	I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it does not need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
1216	1	a	"This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it a slight ""swing"" or ""trapeze"" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4"" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi"
1217	1	a	Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.
1218	1	a	"These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24,25, or 0. you will not regret this purchase."
1219	1	a	I wanted to like this romper, it is very cute and colorful, but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.
1220	1	a	I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well, but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean, i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out), but i do not usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case, but it was still worth it.
1221	1	a	Off the shoulder is everywhere and this is a great shirt for the fall.
1222	1	a	This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!
1223	1	a	I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick, high quality material. i only wish they had more colors! sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well, although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me, although i am small chested, but i would not feel comfortable wearing it to work.
1224	1	a	Great dress for vacations!
1225	0	a	The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably did not help.
1226	1	a	"Yep, absolutely tickled to death with this top. light, airy, cotton poplin with personality plus. such an aesthetically pleasing piece! i have not been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time! this blouse speaks to me...i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the size eight was a tad large-might have gotten a six but this is fine. it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says 'belt' or 'tuck' anyway! the neckline is just too much! it gives such personality to the piece. the open ne"
1227	1	a	Great looking casual dress, but i'm not sure about the fit on me. the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model. bodice fabric is a nice, clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness. the skirt is a thin crepe viscose/rayon without a lining and i think it really needs one. i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi. i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
1228	0	a	The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
1229	1	a	"This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7"" 135 with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w"
1230	0	a	I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just did not fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
1231	0	a	I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight, and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it a bummer.
1232	1	a	Being six feet tall, i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women, and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look, you can sometimes gain extra length, and it true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues, and while it is billowy, it not horribly so. i would think, however, if you're between sizes, or not worried about height, i'd go with the smaller option. adorable, comfy, casual while being dressy enough for a night out!
1233	1	a	I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i do not care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,
1234	1	a	"This is my first romper and i am in love. so comfortable and easily dressed up or down. i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands. the xs worked best for me. the petite small was too big. i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length. i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly."
1235	0	a	This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
1236	1	a	Really like this blouse but am returning for a larger size. much too tight in the upper arms and somewhat tight in the chest - overall i like it.
1237	1	a	"I ca not get over how fabulous this looks on, how well it fits, and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8"" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding, evening out, or the office."
1238	1	a	I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly! it gorgeous in person, and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer.
1239	1	a	I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i do not always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes
1240	1	a	"Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i'm 5'11"", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom."
1241	1	a	"I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy, perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area ""winter"", but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt."
1242	1	a	I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i do not think it intended.i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on
1243	0	a	I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i could not bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).
1244	1	a	I love this top!!! it is soft, flattering, and beautifully cut/designed. i get so many compliments every time i wear it. i have the blue and the green, and wish they had the white in my size. beautifully elegant and can be dressed up or down. best purchase i ever made at retailer!!!
1245	1	a	These jeans are so comfortable and they are made of the softest fabric. i love that they can be dressed up or down. love these!!
1246	1	a	The velvet is not as soft or plush as i thought it would be but these are comfy pants. i wo not wear them until next winter, which is fine.
1247	1	a	I'm a big fan of level 99 jeans and linen pants. these are great-- good quality, flattering fit, lovely color. i got the coral in size 26/petite, and that works for me. they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on, but they'll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy, like my other level 99 linens-- something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit. i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there would not be much
1248	0	a	I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
1249	0	a	"Bought a pair of the gray and loved them, but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine. so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem? anyway - now they both look like there discoloration and not a ""washed look"" that on purpose. i'll still wear them, but an expe"
1250	1	a	I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.
1251	0	a	The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.
1252	1	a	Love this top. it everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white is not white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.
1253	1	a	I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses, this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous, the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!
1254	1	a	"I love this dress. i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was 56"" but it was perfect. i am 5'0 and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect. however, in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer, but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas. the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low."
1255	1	a	"I was so skeptical about ordering this; it really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm"
1256	1	a	"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!"
1257	1	a	"Great, really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it still a little big, but it works. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs."
1258	1	a	"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality."
1259	1	a	Feminine but not too fussy tee is a nice linen-like material. i got the white one which will go with a lot of my skirts, pants and shorts. unlike other reviewers, i did not find it too short for me at all, but i am high-waisted. casual but with extras.
1260	0	a	I lived the front and back designs but did not like the fit.
1261	1	a	This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!
1262	1	a	"I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made, a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3"" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they have not stretched out...highly recommend."
1263	1	a	Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
1264	0	a	This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.
1265	1	a	I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now.
1266	1	a	I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it a bit big, though. opt to size down.
1267	1	a	I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. i'm a size 2 and bought a small.
1268	1	a	I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on, and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top, cropped jeans, and sandals.
1269	1	a	This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable, and flattering even though it not tight fitting. true to size as well.
1270	1	a	This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
1271	1	a	I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!
1272	1	a	130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres
1273	1	a	"I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you do not mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces."
1274	1	a	When i first saw this dress, it honestly did not catch my eye, but as i kept seeing it in on the catalog and other places on pinterest, i realized how unique this dress is. i looked at the reviews and was surprised at how negative the comments were- i'm the type of lady who gets stuck on something and wo not get off of it until i try it for myself. so, i ordered it on sale and i love it! it is not flannel material, and so i was not expecting this to be a dress that would keep me warm by itself- but
1275	1	a	"This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful, and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts.it is very high waisted, and at 5'8"" the length was similar to the model."
1276	1	a	Super cute, well made, great embroidery. waist runs big.
1277	1	a	Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i ca not stop wearing it
1278	1	a	Love this top!it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.love both colors, and having fun wearing them.and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size
1279	1	a	"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i ca not wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the"
1280	1	a	Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.
1281	1	a	Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i ca not go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
1282	1	a	As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it did not fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.
1283	0	a	"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes."
1284	0	a	I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it not blue but instead a dull, mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn, stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it going back for sure.
1285	1	a	"The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming, and continues through details in the pockets.i am 5'6"", 34-26-38 and i wore a size 4 regular and 4 petite. the regulars were very long, and even heels could not help them. the pant leg covered my foot, covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels, so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite"
1286	1	a	I tried on the pink version, really nice, the fit is loose, but flattering. opening at the neck looks nice either tied or not. fabric is airy. it looked nice tucked in or with a wide leg pant. i passed only because the color was not as bright as i need for my pale skin. overall, very nice. xs fit at 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist
1287	1	a	Love this so much! i have received so manu compliments!
1288	1	a	Quality is excellent. i agree with another reviewer that the top runs large. i am usually a medium, but i was swimming in it. i live in alaska and would not know how to return it so i am just keeping it and wearing it on those cool lazy days. i'm sure it would still look classy because of the design.
1289	1	a	Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.
1290	1	a	I love these pants! typically, i have a difficult time finding pants that fit my smaller waist and curvier hips and legs, but these fit well enough. all i need to do it have the waist tailored and they will be perfect. the pants are also soft. the only downside, and it is not a deal breaker for me, is that they run a little large and seem to stretch out a bit with wear. considering this, i would downsize one size.
1291	1	a	"Great dress, nicely structured, but the fabric is very thick and since it lined, it a very ""warm"" dress. not something you would wear in the spring, especially in the summer. ordered in petite, so hem length was perfect on me (i'm 5')."
1292	1	a	As in most ribbed camis, this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.
1293	1	a	I needed a pink dress for a local breast cancer awareness luncheon. this is a perfect fit for the occasion!
1294	1	a	I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!
1295	1	a	I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this,for it will be wonderful for summer.
1296	1	a	This is an awesome thirt and i'm so glad it finally went on sale. i had been eying it for a while: it true to size, can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans. washes great and looks different from other shirts -- the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference. gotten lots of compliments.
1297	1	a	This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it well worth it
1298	1	a	Hi, i bought these in both colors. the material is very nice. for me the only part of the pants that stretched was the waistband. sadly i had to return them.
1299	1	a	Great style and quality. however sizing runs smaller than anticipated.i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me.
1300	0	a	Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and ca not bare to wear them anymore.
1301	1	a	This top is very pretty. it a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.
1302	0	a	The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
1303	1	a	This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!
1304	1	a	"What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9"" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 34 c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short, as i am long waisted, but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out."
1305	1	a	"I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and does not stick to other fabric. i would not quite call it ""gauze"" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it clean and classic. when worn open, it cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish"
1306	0	a	I was so excited to get this in the mail, and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up, but i do not really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i do not know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not, but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.
1307	1	a	"This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute ""lounge at the lake"" ensemble."
1308	1	a	Another keeper! this top is just beautiful, it is so well made. worn with a black cami, chunky necklace and skinny jeans-perfection. the back drapes longer in the back which i liked as well!
1309	1	a	This coat is beautifully made and for $800 i expect no less. however, i should have checked other resources prior to buying. the color on this website is nothing like actual color of coat. i was expecting a nice dark red/wine as depicted on these photos. however, it is a bright magenta/dark fuscia more on the purpleish side that does not go so much with my wardrobe (even though i am a pink-loving person haha). i had hoped to pair it with the same skirt shown here and the peony sweater that was i
1310	1	a	Super easy and cute. i received lots of compliments!
1311	1	a	Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (do not have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
1312	0	a	This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!
1313	1	a	Order a whole size down and this may work. i'm normally a 6-8 or a medium but this was huge. ordered the small because i loved the color/design. hopeful!
1314	1	a	I bought this shirt in blue (because the store was out of gray and i had to have it right then) and it is my favorite. it is comfortable and durable. i also appreciate the length of the shirt. it is long enough for me to not worry about putting my arms up. it is an overall great buy. i want one in every color.
1315	1	a	Great trouser pants for summer with pretty jacquard print and neat denim detail at hem and waist band. usually wear a 6 in retailer but went up a size to 8 with these for looser trouser fit. fits my backend nicely which is always a plus. ca not wait to wear them!
1316	1	a	The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece. i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top. i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design. this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.
1317	1	a	I was not sure about the dress on the rack. lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily. it was on sale so i figured why not? let try it on. it is gorgeous on. true to size. i am usually a 0 and the 0 fits me perfectly. the quality and tailoring is amazing. it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day. overall, i love the fit and quality of the dress. i love it even more on sale!
1318	1	a	"These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs."
1319	1	a	This is a great sweater to wear out over a top or instead of a jacket.the yarn used is super soft and warm. i typically wear a size medium in sweaters and tops and ordered a size medium. it fits perfectly!
1320	1	a	I got this planning to wear to a wedding, but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said, it is long, but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!
1321	1	a	Super comfy cotton top, will be great for hot summer days when my shoulders have had enough sun!
1322	1	a	"Everything about this dress is perfect for my body type. i used the tie belt as a cinch to gather the fabric and made the silhouette into a loose fit & flare. i have a large upper body and small lower half so maybe the excess fabric balances out my body but looks terrible on other shapes. i am 36dd 140# 5'3"" and i purchased the medium petite."
1323	0	a	Disappointing, back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but does not match the fabric on the back at all. ca not imagine why you would do that?
1324	1	a	I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable, classic, good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!it is a bit loose in the middle, but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p
1325	0	a	This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.
1326	1	a	I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!
1327	1	a	I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.
1328	0	a	"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes"
1329	1	a	I adored this when i saw it online, paired with the leather skirt. i waisted impatiently for it to show up and, when it did, was happy at the price point but unsure of how it would feel. for the cut, i would say it runs tts. i am sometimes an xxs but in this case that size was tight across the shoulders. i am worried that the xs will be too roomy in the waist but time will tell. as for quality, well, you can feel the polyester in it, for sure. it nice to have the lining, but i would not say it
1330	0	a	I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color, design and details. however, whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves, it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender, i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.
1331	0	a	I ordered this item when it was first advertised, fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed, the fabric is cheap, the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
1332	1	a	Lovely color and really nice fabric. not much form to the dress but will be lovely with a belt or jacket.
1333	1	a	This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.
1334	1	a	This is a beautiful top. the detail in the pattern of the fabric is gorgeous and the color goes great with jeans. love the design of arm holes, they do not show your bra! the only con is price, but it a keeper.
1335	1	a	This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there room for a light layer underneath.
1336	1	a	This cozy sweater looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. as a 55-year-old woman who loves retailer i'm always on the lookout for cute clothes that do not make me look like i'm trying to dress too young. this sweater is comfy and stylish and looks really classy. i wore it to a holiday party and got many compliments, which is unusual for what is basically a simple ivory sweater. it breathes, has just the right amount of room in the sleeves, and was a great purchase. i wish i had bought other colo
1337	1	a	"This top is not bmeant to be super fitted, it is flowy and ""romantic"". i have ordered the petite to decide which size to keep, but my usual xs was fine, wil ljsut compare length. i was also curious about hte smaller size, but did not order it, so i wil lnever know.the only color i saw in person is the black on, and it is calssic, so i went with it. shall wait for petite verdict!"
1338	0	a	"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest, small waist, muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small, an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls."
1339	1	a	This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it. it is very soft and cozy. i went with the m/l cause i preferred the longer length, even though i also fit in the xs/s. i have worn it many times, and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace. when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers, i throw it on when i get cold-its like a cozy hug. i highly recommend!
1340	0	a	I typically wear a 4/6 but am a little bigger right now, so i went with the medium. was so excited to get these but was very disappointed when i tried them on. they look beautiful, but there is no lining, leaving the fabric uncomfortable. they were also huge! definitely make sure you size down if you d
1341	1	a	Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter slim body
1342	1	a	"When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5""). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!"
1343	1	a	"I am 5'7"" and wanted a swing type of dress that was not too short to be too young or too long to look frumpy and this fits perfect. it very comfortable. it has nice quality in the fabric... not all polyester like many of the swing dresses out now. it a bit longer in the back and has a very ethereal quality without being childlike. it pretty, the sleeves are long enough and the elastic fits well. no pinching. i can wear a full bra with it and both boots and super sexy heels look great wi"
1344	0	a	I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time, thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i do not live close to an retailer, i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal, this sweater however i was swimming in, like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i was not impressed with the material either, it f
1345	1	a	Love these pants. they are comfortable and flattering. i generally go for neutral colors but the blue is a beautiful shade that easy to wear.
1346	0	a	I thought the colors would be brighter and i did not realize the lace would be see through. i returned it because it was also shorter that i expected. but overall it was a nice dress, just not for me.
1347	1	a	"I love this skirt! i was not sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you do not need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34"
1348	1	a	From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!
1349	1	a	The dress is nice, but i was not excited about the color. the only color is this blue. also everyone has their favorite fit. i think i like some other fit better. my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials. otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit.i like to own dresses made of more natural materials.
1350	0	a	I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress is not even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed, i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i do not even want t
1351	1	a	"The dress is lovely. my only knock on it is i did not really feel like the top and the skirt matched in terms of level of dress. i guess the top just was not ""fancy"" enough for me. but it is a very beautiful skirt. i wish it was in a tea length. the fit was spot on."
1352	1	a	I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
1353	1	a	This is cute! i've been so looking forward to it, but it big!! i'm usually a small in retailer size, medium most of the time otherwise. i ordered the medium, but it way too big. does not fit at all like the pictures. sadly, it going back, hopefully for a much smaller size. but other than this, it lovely
1354	0	a	"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it 100% acrylic which is not my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks"
1355	0	a	I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.
1356	1	a	Been on the hunt for jammie so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i do not like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern, however, the fabric is not as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.
1357	0	a	I bought this dress on super sale and it was such a great deal. sadly it going back although i sized down i still feel like the dress is shapeless and tent like. no wonder why the store had so many still at the price i paid. the details on the dress are pretty and it high quality. just wish the fit was better.
1358	1	a	I often find wearing anything described as lim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.
1359	1	a	The pattern, while beautiful, is on a much more yellow-ivory background than pictured. the skirt is very voluminous and the elastic waist seemed very loose, like it would not support the skirt. while i did like it, i did not love it, so it had to go back.
1360	1	a	This top fits a bit trimmer than the summer version of this top did. the lavender color is muted and a nice fall transition color.
1361	1	a	I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!
1362	0	a	"1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6"", 135 lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they do not even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else."
1363	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to work in my second trimester. the shape is perfect to accommodate a baby bump while still flattering the top. definitely recommend for any pregnant women trying to avoid true maternity clothes!
1364	1	a	I love this dress. it is super cute and comfy. i am 5'7 and a size small, 4 and 36c and i got this dress in a 4 and it fits great. a 2 might be a little more fitted on my waist but the 4 is comfortable and looks great. the length is perfect, not too short at all.
1365	1	a	Thicker than you think...the colors are gorgeous and remind you of the changing of the seasons. can not wait to wear when the weather gets cooler. retailer did not disappoint. plan to purchase in other color soon.
1366	1	a	"I am 5'4"", 145 pounds, 34dd and ended up with the size small for reference. it fit well but definitely roomy - in case you're not into that style. never tried the extra small, but i would prefer this dress not to hug onto me so i stayed with the small. this dress was really nice and comfy, soft material. the pockets are low and my phone stayed in while i walked but i would not recommend anything heavier than a phone to go in the pockets. i wore this to a family and friends function and re"
1367	0	a	I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i did not feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it going back.
1368	0	a	I was so excited for this romper, but was disappointed after trying it on. the material felt cheap for the price, and it runs quite small. will be returning. :(
1369	1	a	I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.
1370	1	a	"This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion, it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking ""maternity"". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i'm usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for"
1371	1	a	The details on this blouse are so pretty. it is a bit wide, but it flows nicely. it is also a little shorter than a lot of tops, but i think it will work nicely with higher waisted flares this spring. the sleeve is very flattering. i got medium, my normal size.
1372	1	a	I loved this sweater as soon as i opened the package. it was soft and the colors of grey peach and white were perfect for this to were into the spring time. i am 5'3 102lbs and purchased the xs. the arm length was perfect. the sweater length hit slightly above my hips. the style of the sweater is a bit boxy, but not so much that it looks like your wearing a tent.
1373	1	a	I needed to get this hemmed about 3-4 inches, but it was well worth it. this is a gorgeous, effortlessly glam outfit. the material is silky soft, with some stretch, and drapes beautifully. i am a 12/14 and got an xl-- i think a large would have been better (this had extra width at the waist, but it worked with the tie belt). i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night.
1374	1	a	I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy, and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5'7 and 115 lbs, and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit, but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short, but i did not feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the
1375	1	a	This is a beautiful dress. fits true to size. very flowy and comfortable. the color looks just like the pic.
1376	0	a	I got this in the green color. it a beautiful color, soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i do not mind dry-cleaning my sweaters, so that not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants, the sli
1377	1	a	I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.
1378	1	a	Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.
1379	0	a	I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer. however, this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering, opening to hit you right. i did really like the color ( ordered the brown) and material but back it goes.
1380	1	a	"I had been hearing a bit of hype around this dress. it had seemed that most were either loving or hating it, which can be true for a lot of ""swing"" dresses as some give off that ""baby bump"" vibe. i saw a friend try one on in petite and we both agreed it ran a little short, even for us at just over 5 feet tall. when i finally made it into a store i noticed that they had quite a few in regular sizing in stock. i grabbed a xs regular to try on and i loved it. with heels, it falls perfectly and"
1381	1	a	I bought this in green and i absolutely love it! the quality of material is very fantastic, a durable fabric that will hold up well over time. its a good quality too, so can be dressed up somewhat, and also does well as a very casual piece. love it!
1382	1	a	I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei
1383	1	a	This is an attractive, fitted vest. the tight belt on the back gives it a new look, great shape. the fabric is good quality. the neck is tight and high. i usually get a small at retailer, but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest. judging from the photo, i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium. it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans
1384	1	a	I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.
1385	1	a	The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure
1386	1	a	I live year round in warm weather and found these pants to be a great addition to my wardrobe. flattering and comfortable, the cropped look is a nice alternative to shorts. i'm 5.7 curvy but athletic.143lbs i usually wear an 8 or 10 in retailer but took the 10. i prefer my pants a little less fitted.
1387	1	a	The colors on this blouse are beautiful and even more vibrant in person. i love that the blouse is lightweight, perfect to wear to any holiday gathering!
1388	1	a	Cute white t-shirt different style but did not work on my body type so i returned it good price point basic fabric
1389	1	a	Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.
1390	1	a	I love this blouse, but after i got it i decided i really did not need another white long blouse. it was more of a want than a need. very stylish and comfy with nice neckline. i love retailer anything. i'm obsessed with this store and every single thing in it. even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors.
1391	1	a	I love these cords! soft and great fit. bought three colors!
1392	1	a	I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and ca not believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall
1393	0	a	I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.
1394	1	a	Beautiful crepey fabric, lovely color. i was surprised to see gold threading in the peach option; i'm not a big gold thread fan, but it do-able. the ruching across the back makes the fit very loose and blousy. this is not a figure-defining piece. but it comfortable (will probably be more so after a wash to get that stiffy factory fabric finish feeling out), and versatile.
1395	1	a	"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it a little boxy but very comfy. it definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!"
1396	1	a	I think this is going to be a love or hate top. i love it. it is see through, requiring an under top. however, the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tank/cami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors. i bought the off-white. it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos do not show just how full the back really is. the fabric will probably snag easily. still i just really like the sty
1397	1	a	Ordered in the orange and they are so cute i had to order the other two colors. my normal size 12 fit tts. i am happy with the fabric, fit and color. i have an athletic build and had no issues with the side zip, waist, hip or thighs.
1398	1	a	These bottoms are comfortable, soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.
1399	1	a	An easy top that adds instant glamour. the burnout velvet is super fun for the holidays and yet the design is comfortable and easy. i have found this top can work day and night with the right accessories.
1400	1	a	This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations. very unique and well-made. swing dresses can be a hit or miss, sometimes, but this one is perfect. could not be happier!
1401	1	a	I love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close does not work a lot, outside of that i love it. i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect.
1402	1	a	This dress is stretchy and soft, a great length, and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body, but it certain flattered mine.
1403	0	a	On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.
1404	1	a	I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!
1405	1	a	"The style of this dress is quite lovely, i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store, however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure, i should mention that i am 5'9"" and have an athletic figure but with hips. the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the"
1406	1	a	Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel
1407	0	a	I do not have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length, slits, tie, stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas, it is not meant to be...
1408	1	a	This duster is very nicely put together and is mid-weight. i'm not sure it worth this price point but it not cheaply made, either. the colors are as shown on the website to a 't'. the length is also as shown. i am 5'5 142 lbs and 34d and the small is perfect. i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect. colors are dark teal, salmon and gold. this is a three seaso
1409	1	a	These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures, but is still a pretty color. do not expect any give or stretch with these shorts.
1410	1	a	So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good, sleeves are a not too tight.
1411	0	a	I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i could not even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it a shame because it a really cute dress.
1412	1	a	Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.
1413	1	a	Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.
1414	1	a	Great mock neck fits well and looks great with pants and skirts!! also love the dark grey color!!
1415	1	a	I wanted to love this blouse, but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty, so the placement of the peplum just did not work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size, but the peplum just did not work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.
1416	0	a	"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i could not believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it had not been so big."
1417	0	a	I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
1418	1	a	I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago, both in the small. great jumpsuit and true to size. i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine (in cold) but caught it before the dryer. it still fits, although it seems a bit shorter in the legs.
1419	1	a	"The colors of this dress really caught my eye. i was hesitant to try it in the store because they only had a size 4 and i'm normally a size 6. when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised that the dress fit around my hips. success! but like the other women that commented, there was something funky going on in the midriff area. the dress did not accentuate my curves. the stylist was available at the store i was at, so she recommended that i belt it to add that extra ""umph"". the belt definitely di"
1420	1	a	"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.this feels incredibly silky. it lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it longer in the b"
1421	1	a	This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!
1422	0	a	I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if was not a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just did not flatter - made me feel 10 years older
1423	1	a	I got the ivory. it very cute under the split back cloth & stone button down denim in slightly oversized top (i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down). this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium. the top snags easily. it pricey but i love it.
1424	1	a	Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.
1425	1	a	"I have loved this dress from the first time i saw it. but the price scared me away until a sale came to be that meant i could justify buying it. honestly it worth it original price, i'm just too much of a scrooge to pay it! the details are adorable. the length makes it very versatile. it seems well made and pretty weighty. fits nicely due to the elastic in the back; i got an 8.. i weigh 170, 5'8"" with a small chest. most of the dresses i buy are just as much art as they are fashion and this"
1426	1	a	It hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy, but does not look bulky. this sweater does it all. it is delicate looking and soft and flattering. it is also surprisingly warm. i wear it with jeans for everyday, but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such. i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me (blond and fair). i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale. i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters.
1427	1	a	Yes, this is a bit expensive; however, it is made in the usa, so that is a very good thing. i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality, well-designed basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country. when you are considering this pretty top, please click on the gold so that you can see the detail. it is very well-made and flattering. i love how it has a slight shape at the back, very flattering and feminine. the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com
1428	1	a	Love love! i am thick in waist and have thinner thighs and legs and these fit beautifully !! size down one size. very comfy. no muffin top or tummy rolling over and nice boyfriend look without being too baggy. very cute. so happy i found these. worth trying on.
1429	1	a	"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit."
1430	0	a	I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.
1431	1	a	I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly, the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.
1432	1	a	This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.
1433	1	a	Was not sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.
1434	1	a	These jammie pants are quite beautiful and comfortable. the material used is great, very light and thin. i found these to run really big though, definitely order a size down!!
1435	1	a	"I just bought this dress yesterday in the store and love it. i'm 5'1"", 110#, 34b and purchased the 0p, which fits perfectly.it made of a cool material and is lined which adds to the quality of the dress. i love the neutral print and the square v-neck makes it a little different than just an average dress. this dress can be dressed up or down, depending on accessories. it also makes a great work dress if you add a little cardigan or blazer. very versatile and a great buy, especially a the s"
1436	1	a	"I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small, however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of ""i need to borrow that from you""! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4"" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!"
1437	1	a	I definitely recommend this shirt. it lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.
1438	1	a	The flow and feel of the material is really nice, however, i think it runs large. i ordered a small, and i have exchanged it for an xs, which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there.
1439	1	a	"I am 5'1"" and curvy, and purchased this dress in medium petite, and it fits to perfection! i love how light & breezy it is for those hot & muggy summer days. the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types, and the skirt is lined so it is not see-through! plus, the pockets. this dress is a winner."
1440	1	a	I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it. the detail is so exquisite, it will be worth every penny.
1441	1	a	This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. ca not wait to use it at the beach.
1442	1	a	Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend day.i have it in black but thinking of buying in the yellow/orange color too.
1443	1	a	"I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!"
1444	1	a	Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome.
1445	1	a	I really liked this top the minute i saw it online, long enough and elegant at the same time. i'm 6 ft tall and i like to wear my stuff loose & have my back well covered. i usually get m/l depending on the fabric and style, got this top in l. this top however turned out to be larger than expected, there is plenty of room on the sides, and that bottom part is made of a thinner cotton material. the fabric of the top is not as soft as it may look, but the pullover is still very cute, maybe after fe
1446	1	a	Such a cute and comfy dress to wear. colors are vibrant just as they appear in the picture. the m fit was better for me than the small. ( 5'7', 140lbs for reference.) it such a great dress to throw on and go. love it!
1447	1	a	I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.
1448	1	a	This shirt is such a pretty color i was so excited to get it... however i felt like the fit was not flattering. it sort of just hung on me. did not do much for me. i actually ended up returning it.
1449	1	a	Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors are not look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it wo not make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.
1450	1	a	"These jeans fit pretty well on my petite frame, although wish they were more cropped. for reference i am 5'4"" 110 lbs. i was looking for frayed jeans for this fall and these jeans are on trend. i may look at petite options which would be truly cropped. overall they are very stretchy skinny jeans and have a nice dark wash."
1451	0	a	This hoodie was too thin. you can see right through it. i returned it.
1452	1	a	Cute skirt and print, but high waisted. also was more snug so think it runs a tad small. i wanted to tuck in a shirt like shown in picture, but it looks goofy because the waist is so high. also there is no flexibility there so size up if you want to wear it lower. the model arms are covering her waist so hard to tell what proportion looks like on her. i'm 5'4 so might work better on a taller person. sending back.
1453	1	a	I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.
1454	1	a	I loved this dress, i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great, loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
1455	0	a	"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
1456	1	a	"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me."
1457	0	a	This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it just not flattering. in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit. sending back.
1458	1	a	These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
1459	1	a	These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.
1460	0	a	"This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers are not fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly"
1461	1	a	This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern. fell in love with the fabric. looks great with high-waist pants.
1462	1	a	Beautiful dress! it looks fresh, feminine and the quality of the fabric is very nice.
1463	1	a	This vest is so cute and a perfect transition piece for fall. it runs a little big. i normally wear an xs, but i had to exchange for an xxs
1464	1	a	Fell in love at first site, cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure.
1465	1	a	This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi
1466	1	a	Beautifully made, designer sweater. and it soft and comfortable. i decided to return because it just too much for my body. the fringe, which is quite long, overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am. the color is true white. the knit itself is fuzzy. it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline. although not for me, i do recommend.
1467	1	a	It a very light material, so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it still fairly warm. such a cute jacket, has no zipper or buttons though, so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!
1468	1	a	I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. ca not wait to wear it!
1469	1	a	I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i did not find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.
1470	1	a	Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i do not love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.
1471	0	a	I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.
1472	1	a	I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.
1473	1	a	I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high, and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy, too stretchy, too scratchy, too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews, and as soon as i tried it on, i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable, and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i
1474	1	a	I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it has not pilled. it washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you do not want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.
1475	1	a	I ordered this online. it fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.
1476	0	a	The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it styled on the model, and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because, mainly, it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it, i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric nice and good quality. but honestly, if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
1477	0	a	Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store did not have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this was not flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.
1478	1	a	After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.
1479	1	a	If you already own at least one of the four versions of the morning glory dress, then you will know what size of the canna swing dress to buy. sleeves are slightly full with button closures. slip is tts and the outer dress is huge! easy to cinch if you want a fit & flare style. just know what you like--complainers about how baggy this dress is are forewarned. those who really want to size down are slim/slender/petite types. if you do not want to wear the tent-like swing style, size down one or tw
1480	1	a	Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on! the print is adorable and colors are vibrant. the material is heavier than i'd like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway. will be great for work. i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker. seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets!
1481	1	a	Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall
1482	0	a	This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
1483	1	a	I love this top! looks great with just about any kind of jean (skinny, flare, especially high waisted). even looks good with vests and cardigans. a perfect versatile piece for the fall - you wo not regret!
1484	1	a	This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it, styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!
1485	1	a	"Definitely order down a size. i am almost always an xl (big chest, broad shoulders) but the l in this fits me perfectly. well worth the sale price, a fun boho transition piece!it is a ""reverse print"" so the inside is brighter than the outside, but i like the blurred paisley print--it subtle.the back detail is great and very flattering.it is quite full and flowy, but in a flattering way, i think. just restrained enough."
1486	0	a	Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
1487	1	a	Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.
1488	1	a	I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering, but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
1489	1	a	I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i did not think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i did not mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.
1490	1	a	"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear."
1491	1	a	I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul
1492	1	a	This is a beautiful warm cardigan! just from the picture thought it was going to be longer. bought to wear with leggings but ca not. i will wear it with jeans skirts and dresses. i am 5 feet 7.
1493	1	a	This dress is exactly what i needed. it so easily dressed up or down. heels and jewelry for cocktail this time.
1494	1	a	"When i saw this slip/nighty on-line i loved it! most of the night-gowns i own are from retailer and i am very pleased with them. i ordered my normal size small and it fit well. for reference i am 5' 1"" and 120lbs, 35c. the only slight issue is that the fabric is quite sheer, not a big deal since one is wearing this item to sleep in, but it would have been better in my opinion if it was not so see-through. also this may not matter to anyone but the stitching along the top is a bright neon pin"
1495	1	a	I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.
1496	1	a	This top is light and airy, but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big, but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.
1497	1	a	This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is
1498	0	a	Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i ca not imagine this would look good on anyone.
1499	0	a	This is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit, as described by other reviewers, is slightly off. i am 34d 5'5 and 140 lbs. the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket. the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected. one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all. the dress just was not me, i guess, so this one is going home to retailer...
1500	1	a	Just received this in black and am in love! it has a stevie nicks vibe and i look forward to wearing it as a swimsuit cover up, dress with black slip underneath, and even with a black tank and skinny jeans! it really is beautiful. i am 5'3 and was worried it would be too long, but it just hits above ground with flats, and will work even better with wedges.it is big and will flatter a variety of sizes... even though i'm a 6/8 i do not feel like it too overwhelming.my only concern is how
1501	1	a	Great jean! i will live in these this winter. so flattering, bum looks good, leg is slender and lengthening. perfect petite jean with a flared leg.
1502	0	a	Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
1503	0	a	So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.the constr
1504	1	a	Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish
1505	1	a	I love this top! it perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.
1506	1	a	This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i do not have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.
1507	1	a	Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.
1508	1	a	"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference, i am 5'9"", 150 lbs., 34dddd, and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and, with my height, i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks."
1509	1	a	This tank was much needed for my wardrobe. i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut. i am 130lbs and purchased an xs .
1510	1	a	I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.
1511	1	a	I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.
1512	1	a	Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.
1513	1	a	"I love this top! i was hesitant about purchasing based on the other reviews but i'm so happy i decided to order this beautiful top! i'm 5'4"" 115lbs and the xs fits great. it does run a lititle big but i like slightly over-sized tops with skinny jeans. the xxs probably would have worked as well. i definitely reccomend giving this top a try but size down if you are going for a more fitted look. the lace detail give this staple piece a nice added detail!"
1514	1	a	I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace is not super delicate so it seems like it should last.
1515	1	a	I purchased these jeans in my regular size. they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels.. i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look. they are very stretchy and soft. have worn a few times and they retained thier shape...
1516	0	a	Colors washed me out, i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model
1517	1	a	Found this randomly in the store (online return) and did not expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it. extremely comfortable dress, but also has a unique/special design that makes you feel great wearing it. will be perfect to wear out when do not want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard.
1518	1	a	"I have been in love with white lace tops lately. i saw in the description that there was a ""polyester lining"" - i'm really not into wearing a cami all the time as it takes away from the lace (my personal opinion). so i'm a little disappointed there there is no lining. very pretty. styling is a bit more ""swing""."
1519	1	a	This dress is perfection! very flattering and pretty.
1520	1	a	Great looking, please dry clean it or you'll ruin it, fits well, easy to make an outfit look stylish
1521	0	a	No, but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8, a size 6 on top, 8 on bottom. i do not love this on the model online, but i saw this on naomi blog, love taza, and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer, and while they only had a m/l, since i'm tall, i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it huge. like, it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model, and does not arc down in a drape nearly as well, so just looks, huuuge. i thought i was bein
1522	1	a	Purchased this maxi dress in blue print, size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model, but that fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.
1523	1	a	When i saw these lounge pants, i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you wo not regret it!
1524	1	a	"I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it not -- but that my fault and i love it anyway! it perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly."
1525	1	a	"This top is perfect! i'm 5'9"" and a medium build, and it hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it my new go to top!!"
1526	1	a	I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i, too, found these ran a little small and went up a size.
1527	0	a	First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just does not fit my style. that ok because they still have some good basics. what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i ca not help but think i'm wearin
1528	1	a	I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!
1529	1	a	I just revieved this skirt and like it a lot. they did not have my size in petite so i ordered the regular length . it is very long. i am 5'4 1/2 and tried it with 4 inch heels and still had about 2 inches dragging on the floor and will need to be hemmed. in this picture, the stitching around the flowers appear white but it is actuallly a shiny, delicate gold thread in person. hopefulluy it will not fray with wear. i initially got a white top to go with it and it works, but i think a red or navy
1530	1	a	...a little long still, but loved the fit.flattering on me, i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect. color (wash) was also very nice in my opinion. can be wrn with any top, really, i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price, but on my wish list for sure!
1531	1	a	This was way too big on me, so i gave it to a friend. not only does it fit her really well and look great, but it has become her new favorite sweater! love the casual everyday style, and am tempted to order one in a smaller size for myself.
1532	0	a	I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i ca not wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.the birds of paradise are just lovely, not exactly the same on every suit, but still nice. i just
1533	0	a	This is cut very strangely, i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
1534	1	a	Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.
1535	1	a	Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!
1536	1	a	This jacket is absolutely beautiful. the color is a much deeper navy than it appears in the pictures, and the brocade with the contrasting lining is lovely. however, as another reviewer commented, the back across the shoulders is incredibly small. i ordered up from my normal 2 to a 4, and it was still too tight. there is no way i could even lift my arms over my head without ripping out the back of the jacket. i fear a 6 will be too big. this one is going back, sadly.
1537	1	a	What a great light dress for spring and summer evenings. i love the length and the laid back style. this dress is true to size.
1538	0	a	Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist, sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater, but it had to go back because it looked, um, used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned, sadly.
1539	0	a	I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband does not stretch all the way around. bummer.
1540	1	a	"I like this sweater. i bought it in small and medium because it was 25% off and i did not want my size to sell out. im keeping the small. im 5'5"" and 140 lbs and hourglass. the medium was way too much fabric. its still roomy in the small, but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots. i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person. i think the beige may wash me out. hope this helps."
1541	1	a	This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.
1542	1	a	"Tried it on in store and had to have it. so soft and easy to throw on. i'm 5'6"" and it hits at the knee. i usually wear an xs or small in tops and the xs fit great."
1543	0	a	The sweater could be really pretty, but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it too bad, because the stitching was beautiful, but this item is going back.
1544	1	a	I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.
1545	1	a	This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.
1546	1	a	You just need to be a little more careful but the unique popcorn stitch makes this an attractive statement sweater. i am 5'4 and 127 lbs and was a little surprised how cropped the cut on the size small was compared to how it appears on the photographed models.
1547	1	a	Really gorgeous dress...great fabric/weight, great color & style. runs one size small. i ordered my regular 6 but had to return...hope the 8 works!!!
1548	1	a	I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.
1549	1	a	This top is great under a blazer for work, can be tucked into a skirt and looks great with jeans.necklaces work great with this neckline unless they are short. the sea green is wonderful! i like the snug armholes but may be a problem for some. my hips are larger than my bust so i had to be convinced to try this on and i'm glad i was overruled. i am a small or medium in retailer tops and i got a small.
1550	1	a	I'm a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall
1551	1	a	The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.
1552	0	a	I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately, i could not make the fit work. for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers, i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms, and i do not have particularly large arms, so i ordered the sp, hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately, the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l
1553	1	a	"Love this little ""throw on and feel comfortable all day"" tee shirt"
1554	1	a	"Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material, the bell sleeves, the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder, due to the elastic neckline, but i prefer it on, as pictured on the model. the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro"
1555	1	a	Love this brand, wish there was more available. always a perfect fit and excellent quality! great color, more rich and red than what you see in pic.
1556	1	a	This wrap is awesome. soft material, perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!), and warm, great for layering.
1557	1	a	"Have not seen a top as fun and unique as this without being ""too much"" in a long time. i typically like a little longer with skinny jeans/leggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind. it the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out (not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo), the ""bell"" at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties. the color is beautiful and i"
1558	0	a	This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t
1559	1	a	I ordered this dress in a 12 which is my usual size and it was tight around the waist and across the back. i am 5'7 170lbs, small chest but broader shoulders and back and curvy butt. this dress is beautiful quality and well made but was too snug. it was very long, to the point where i would only be able to wear heels. the belt is cheap looking, i would recommend replacing it with something nicer. the waist drops slightly below the natural waist and the top puckers over it in the front and back.
1560	1	a	So beautiful! i got the xs and it fits tts! it goes with everything! perfect weekend addition!
1561	1	a	Very pretty and soft, love this designer. be warned it definitely runs large. it supposed to be loose-fitting, but i ordered my normal size and it looked as though i was wearing my husband shirt.
1562	1	a	I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.
1563	1	a	Even though this is an online exclusive, i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!
1564	0	a	Did not work on this curvy gal.sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.major pass.
1565	1	a	This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
1566	1	a	I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i do not feel like i see myself all over town.
1567	1	a	Like others are saying, the sleeve and bust are running small. i found out that when i was trying the blue color one (butterfly). however, before trying the blue one, i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size (s), it fit me perfectly, no issue with the sleeve and bust. i do not understand why they're different.
1568	0	a	Lovely color and sweet top, but the fabric was so itchy i could not wear it.
1569	0	a	"This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher"
1570	1	a	I saw a lady trying this on in the store and fell in love with sweater. picture does not do it justice! there is so much detail. my usual size is small and it fit perfect. well worth price.
1571	1	a	This shirt is really cute. i love the color and design. i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.
1572	1	a	When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust, and the peplum just made me look like i did not have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top, but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures.
1573	0	a	I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/could not even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it a shame because th
1574	1	a	Love this sweater! it is so cozy! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot. i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding. i am hoping to buy other colors.
1575	0	a	Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.
1576	1	a	This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i was not too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that both classic and mode
1577	1	a	"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)"
1578	1	a	To be honest, i bought this sweater as an add-on so i could get free shipping; however, it the only piece i actually kept from the order! this sweatshirt is warm (fleece-lined) and just the right amount of billow. but the best part is the subtle lavender color; when i ordered it, i did not even realize i ordered lavender (again, i was not paying much attention to this piece!), but the color and texture are so soft...definitely a must buy! for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and the xs (my usual
1579	0	a	I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on, but within a day of wear, i noticed significant pilling, which made it appear much older / worn.
1580	1	a	This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.
1581	0	a	Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just did not really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it very pretty. but looked horrible.
1582	1	a	So versatile and comfortable. i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months. if you prefer baggier fit, i would suggest going up a size.
1583	1	a	Great style but not so great quality:(stone fell off right away.but they still look great
1584	0	a	These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i wo not even exchange for a bigger size.
1585	1	a	Great jeans, great cut, great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26.
1586	0	a	This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture does not do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just did not find it flattering at all. the slip was not the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i did not think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
1587	1	a	This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
1588	1	a	Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb, 34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect, the top is huge, especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however, the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.
1589	1	a	"Love these pants. very figure flattering and fabric stretch holds up well. no sag at end of day. i am 5'6.5"" and size 6 hits ankle bone. i love these so much i went to order a second pair and size 6 sold out so i ordered an 8 . will see how a size bigger works. i think may give a looser look but be comfy. so happy to have these. wear with booties and my tunics, peasant blouses and much more. highly recommend."
1590	1	a	Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!
1591	1	a	I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception. i am a 32b and broad shouldered and my normal size 6 fit like a dream. the white print is opaque so no bra see-through. such a cute, fun print! the fabric has a really soft hand too.
1592	1	a	I just bought this today so i ca not say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people wo not have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.
1593	0	a	I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o
1594	1	a	This is a lovely dress looks very expensive, nice fabric and detail. i'm 6ft tall 160lb. i normally order a l/10 but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out. length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but then again i'm pretty tall. you ca not really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment, which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric. size wise, i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized. it sits we
1595	0	a	"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10"", and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model, and the cut was just too wide under the armpits."
1596	1	a	This dress is gorgeous on the hanger and even more gorgeous on. definitely runs big though, so sizing down is probably best.
1597	1	a	"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i ca not seem to have enough black tops."
1598	1	a	I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i did not want to say that they ran large, because they are not too loose.
1599	1	a	A little treat for me. i work from home and am sick of all my boring tops. this is a comfy little updo number.
1600	1	a	This jacket was a gift for my daughter,it fit like a glove and she loved it !
1601	1	a	I found this dress to be perfect for the winter season. its warm, sleek, and classy. this dress is made in the usa so it is worth the price. i love the opening on the back and find it be flattering. it can be worn with tights for the winter and easily worn without in the summer. a wise investment for my closet!
1602	1	a	Size down, runs a bit large, sleeves are cute and overall a pretty piece
1603	1	a	I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!
1604	1	a	This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline, but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice, wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels.
1605	1	a	Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.
1606	1	a	This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!
1607	1	a	These wide cut stretchy demon trousers are so flattering; i'm 6' and 160, which translates into curvy territory. i did not need extra length, and the size 32 was bigger than i need, but not too big. these are very classy looking, and go with sandals to booties for every type of look, summer to winter, with a breezy top or a cozy sweater. the revisitation of bell bottoms and culottes had me slightly down: those cuts are not the most flattering for most people. these jeans are smart but trendy;
1608	1	a	I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans, booties, simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.
1609	1	a	Love these leggings. great fit, great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.
1610	1	a	"I find this romper looks much more crisp on the picure than in real life. i find it more slouchier and shapeless even though i went with my ""smaller size"". the material is very soft, but thin, that is maybe the reason. i am not sure if i am going to keep. i wanted a bit more stunning look for my money. not saying this might be a great romper for somebody else however"
1611	1	a	"Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4"" too long. i am 5'8"" so heels would fix the issue but i do not want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants."
1612	1	a	"In accordance with other reviewers, the pictures do not do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold, silver, and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper, especially on sale!"
1613	1	a	I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight , and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60 vibe that i love. i think it should keep it shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large, as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this
1614	1	a	I love this skirt, the colors and the softness. i am little disappointed though that the skirt shrunk quite significantly in a cold water hand wash after the second time of wearing. i do not know if it is the material but i followed the instructions for washing. i am going to keep the skirt because i love it so much and hope that it might stretch a little out with wear and go back to its normal size. despite the shrinkage, i highly recommend.
1615	1	a	I'm an xl in all retailer tops, and sometimes the xl are still too small to fit loosely; i do not like to wear tight clothes. having said that, i had to purchase this top in a size small because it was just cut so large. the sleeves hang a bit odd if you do not get the correct size. i love the feel of the blouse, the fabric is a nice quality. i recommend giving it a try but have patience during the process of figuring out the size that will look best on you in this blouse.
1616	1	a	Great print and material, but this top runs large. i'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries, but this was just big. i reordered in a medium.
1617	1	a	This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.
1618	1	a	"Fit is ""breezy"" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well. the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it."
1619	1	a	I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it would not ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.
1620	1	a	This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding, even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - would not that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit, enhancing the lines of the dress - does not stick out, does not make you look like your wearing a dr
1621	1	a	These are thicker and do not have as much stretch, needed to go up from my usual 26 to a 27. good for late summer to fall transition due to the wash.
1622	1	a	I bought this dress tonight and i love it! the fit is perfect and the color is perfect! the dress runs true to size, as all dolan products do. i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots. love this dress and think everyone should give it a try!
1623	1	a	I do not normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i did not know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th
1624	0	a	I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile, useful and fun, so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.the fabric is nice, p
1625	1	a	So happy this came back into stock! beautiful trench! love the flared skirt. the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast. it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit. a must!
1626	1	a	Great layering top. so comfy, feels soft as my pjs. bought it in 3 colors.
1627	1	a	I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip do not spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
1628	1	a	Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
1629	1	a	I bought this item in store, in the loden green color. i absolutely love it as a light winter dress or tunic. the material is thin, but provides a nice coverage nonetheless. it is super duper comfy, and very figure flattering! i wear it mainly as a dress, and looks great with tights and ankle boots. so pleased ordering the other color.
1630	1	a	I got this dress and think it just great. it a bit formal, but a bit whimsical at the same time. i really disagree with others said about the opening along the arms. i think they are barely noticeable but are nice surprise. this is a perfect california winter dress. i could see how a woman in colder parts of the country might not appreciate the slits on the arms but i think it nice to show a little skin in a conservative way. i plan to wear it to a classical music concert soon. and i got i
1631	1	a	The colors are so pretty, a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!
1632	1	a	I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, do not be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
1633	1	a	"After eyeing this online several times, i saw it at my local store. in person it is just so pretty. it does have a romantic look to it. i was not looking for it... the sa was wearing it! she is much taller than i & it draped nicely over her denim jeans. says she loves it & just had to have it. well, of course, i was going to try it too! at 5'3"", 117#, it was to my knees in the front, longer in the back. a little on the overwhelming side. love the crinkly fabric, embroidery detail, short sleeves &"
1634	0	a	I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.
1635	1	a	Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.
1636	1	a	I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.
1637	1	a	This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
1638	1	a	I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store. it is a beautiful dress. not see through at all. substantial weight, not to heavy and so very beautiful. i stayed tts on it . i would have purchased it but was buying 3 other dresses.. i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days.
1639	1	a	I love almost everything about this. first, you know, it cashmere -- soft soft soft without being heavy. i'm a little afraid to wear it it so nice. i got the gray, which is a beautiful, light, casual shade of gray that looks great with everything. the pockets are fantastic if a bit useless (they hang lower than i can reach with my hands).the construction is a bit odd at first. it took me some brow-furrowing to figure out how to put it on, and i do not love the way the two front panels hang
1640	1	a	This is a great fall shirt. great for dressing up casual wear!!!
1641	1	a	This dress is so soft, and fits like a dream. i'm a new mom and the tie perfectly masks what left of my mummy tummy, while still helping me feel stylish for fall!
1642	1	a	I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl
1643	1	a	I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous, and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
1644	1	a	I absolutely love this shirt! i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it. all they had in stock was a size 2 and a size 8. i'm usually a 4-6 in button-up shirts, but i tried the 2 anyway and found it to be quite generously sized. i have a 32dd bust, so button-up shirts rarely fit me properly. this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in, and was loose-fitting without being sloppy. when i discovered that it came in petite sizes, i asked the so to order t
1645	1	a	This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion, it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.
1646	1	a	I love this top! fits great n is elegant. great for the workplace n a night out. absolutely beautiful! quality fabric. love love love!
1647	1	a	This is figure featuring without being too tight. it fits exactly like the picture. it is a bit pricey, but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan. i love it!
1648	0	a	"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it does not look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short."
1649	1	a	I really love the color of this item. it is very generous in cut. i would suggest sizing down as i like my clothes more fitted. i received many compliments among my colleagues who wearing.
1650	0	a	I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
1651	1	a	I have worn this to work, errands, yoga. it a great tee. love it!
1652	1	a	This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it a soft jersey material that does not cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.
1653	1	a	This top was really cute but the side slits were just a little to high for my taste. maybe a size up would have worked better.
1654	1	a	I tried on the xs in store (would need xxs i think, it is short enough to not need petite). anyway, the neck part was really bunching up on me (between neck and girls), it was not flattering. the rest of the tank is really pretty and flattering though, but the bunching was enough for me to leave it behind. the fabric is soft, and the color is nice warm neutral. i love the lace back with the subtle layer of satiny looking fabric. overall goo, perhaps i do not have the right shoulder shape fr this.
1655	1	a	"If i had to describe on two words, that would be it. the material is not a stiff no-give material, nbut rahter a soft stretchy material, with some depth (the design has ""grooves"", not sure how to explain it#. if you are short, i would definitely go with petite though, it was a little too long on regular size and hit in the ""wrong"" spot on my calves. very flattering, and nice cut. i dind't order yet as it is new and i jsut bought a few dresses... but in my basket forh te next ""sale"" :) #if they s"
1656	1	a	I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for
1657	1	a	I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it!
1658	1	a	Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs
1659	0	a	The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips, emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall, the pants were a miss.
1660	1	a	I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. ca not wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.
1661	1	a	Great, comfy shirt! long enough that i can wear it with leggings!
1662	1	a	This tunic is a lighter weight knit that is not bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.
1663	0	a	I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you.
1664	1	a	This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful. very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking. (i am 5 ft 8 in tall). even sizing up, it far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!
1665	1	a	I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it a great color, soft, flowy, fun, practical.
1666	0	a	After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
1667	0	a	It a cute idea, but it so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool, flowing summer top, but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.
1668	1	a	Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size, the fabric has very little give but is comfortable.
1669	0	a	"This shirt arrived today, and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary, and if i order it again, it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size, xs petite. i'm 5-2"", so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store, i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!"
1670	1	a	Perfect trans top. skinnies or boyfriend and booties. love the mixed prints
1671	0	a	Even on sale, this was just too pricey for what it is, which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps, but it hangs very wide off your chest.
1672	1	a	In person the colors are prettier and it more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it too big:(
1673	1	a	"This skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric. i did not have the ""see-through"" issue that the other reviewer mentioned, my main concerns were the length (i'm 5'1 and it almost goes to my ankles) and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band. i'm between a small and a medium and went with the small. it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead."
1674	0	a	Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
1675	1	a	"I'll admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer, but not necessarily the quality. however, this dress happily has both! the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits. i do think the sizing is off; i'm 5'5"", 137, 34b and the medium (my usual size) was huge, small was still gaping under the arms, and xs fit perfectly. i have not worn an xs in anything since middle school, ha! the banding at the bust does make it tight, so i can we"
1676	0	a	"I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package, as the color was darker than on the picture.i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design, it is not for me as the color is too ""winter""."
1677	1	a	This is such a cute dress, and i do not know why know one has reviewed it yet. its different and fun, i have worn it to work once and have gotten several compliments on it. i found that it does run a bit short so i wore it with leggings.
1678	1	a	"Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8"", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me."
1679	1	a	"I cannot speak more highly of these jeans! i am a standard size 2, 5'3"" and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away. i *always* have to hem them by massive amounts. these jeans are so flattering, the wash is amazing. i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far, but i think the possibilities are endless. i am petite but in a curvy way and i have not felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long. the wash is great for dress up/dress down. i have"
1680	0	a	I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress is not even an ivory it more of a pea green! so disappointed.
1681	1	a	The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice, it makes them look wide and short. well, that might be why these are percect for me, but on my body type (muscular bottom), they are awesome. the material is stretchy, soft, and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color, so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs, i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly, but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal
1682	1	a	Love this shirt! looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans. very flattering with the banded hem, and the material is soft.
1683	1	a	I needed this dress as soon as i saw it on a mannequin in the store. unfortunately, when i tried on my usual size (4 regular), the armholes were so big that you'd be able to see my bra no matter what. i purchased a 4 petite online later that day. it fits perfectly! i received so many compliments on this dress. a few issues though: (1) this dress wrinkles like crazy. i know it linen, but i looked like a mess after wearing it for just a few hours. definitely do not wear it to work and expect to l
1684	1	a	"I was not sure about this dress when i ordered it online, but thought i would give it a try. i am 5'2"" (ordered an xs) and thought i may be too short to pull something like this off, and that it might look like a moo-moo or maternity dress on me. but, i absolutely love it! my husband does too...very sexy and low-key. i wore it for the first time today and received 5 compliments within an hour! this is going to be one of my favorites!"
1685	0	a	I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist, in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity, even in a petite xs, so it going back.
1686	1	a	I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i did not know loved it. it worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer.
1687	1	a	This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.
1688	1	a	I really like the look of this dress, but i ended up returning it because it was too short. the shoulder area was also too big on me.
1689	1	a	"This shirt is incredibly comfortable. the material is so soft, and it fits so well. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with a 32b chest and i purchased a small - it is large on me, and i would have preferred an xs, but the small is just fine as well! it is a great shirt, especially for an oversized henley. 100% recommend. (one star off for the larger sizing.)"
1690	0	a	"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison, and i wish all reviewers would include this, i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it."
1691	1	a	Beautiful dress appears well-made, but unfortunately i was not able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
1692	1	a	"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future."
1693	0	a	I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely, more of a grayish blue, and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good, as it thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it does not look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger, so it does sit on your hips, however the sweater is not slimming cause of the odd shape
1694	1	a	I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.
1695	1	a	Nice practical tank, that i can wear with everything. but, the fabric is kind of weird - overly warm and pulls up around the bottom when i wear it sometimes. i would still recommend it, but just know it not just a cotton tank.
1696	1	a	"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7"", 133, and a 36a. if you have been considering this dress, do not delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!"
1697	1	a	"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i did not find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin"
1698	1	a	Its a pleasure to wear this sweater! it feels like you are wearing a hug! it that cozy! yet, it almost weightless, which is nice for me because i get overheated easily. the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only. i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort!
1699	1	a	I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl
1700	1	a	I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it pretty versatile too.
1701	1	a	I agree with the previous review that this dress runs large. otherwise, it is a lovely dress, though i added a belt since the tie was not defining enough for me. brown leather looks great with it and i get tons of complements.
1702	1	a	I bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer, and it so cute. unfortunately the fit is not perfect. the medium fits my waist perfectly, but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders. if i wanted to spend the money, i could get it tailored, but i just felt like it might not be worth it. side note - this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking!
1703	1	a	I usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size. i personally loved the fit. in the front, the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line. there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden. the fabric falls nicely there. the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist. i love both of the prints. the tops seem to be well made. time will tell.
1704	1	a	Love, love, this top! it flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.
1705	1	a	The beaded shoulders make this a unique tee shirt. it turns an ordinary tee shirt into a more eye-catching one. i bought 2 different colors and love them. i prefer the little boxier fit as it is very flattering. the material is a nice weight, not too thin.
1706	1	a	Since there is not one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
1707	1	a	This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!
1708	1	a	This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form. that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down. 5'2, 145 lbs= s. i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus! hints of peach and beautiful lace detail. i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers. i paired it with a dark denim jacket. absolute must have for sale price.
1709	1	a	They were fine. i had hoped they'd be more like begging a though... more structure. they were very much just leggings and rather unflattering in the crotch area. they felt well made though. might work for someone else. not a bad legging.
1710	1	a	This top is so beautiful! whenever i wear it i get lots of compliments. i have washed it a few times on delicate and it still looks great. i do have to wear a cami under it, but the way the straps of the top are made, you cannot see see my bra or cami strap.
1711	1	a	I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. i'm between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six, but it definitely tight. i have a larger chest, and it pretty low and sexy, though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. i've also put shirts under it and it a super cute jumper. i'm 5'1 and the dress (regular, not petite) hits right below my knee.
1712	0	a	I too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.
1713	1	a	I was so excited about this dress. but when i got it, there were several issues i had with it. the neck is just too high for me and the skirt is too pleated and makes my hips look wide. i was hoping for more of an a-line cut. gorgeous though! wish it worked.....
1714	1	a	When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that gonna have to go back
1715	0	a	This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i do not understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other does not. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders
1716	1	a	Ordered online, just received this vest, so disappointed! love the garment but it is way too small. i wear a medium in most clothing and size 6 in a dress, but the medium in this vest is not just snug it is definitely too small, even worn alone, i ca not button it. i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it. hoping i wo not need to return both the m and the l, thinking of ordering an xl.
1717	1	a	I wanted to love this shirt. it not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just was not flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just was not right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
1718	1	a	This shirt looked plain online, but when i see it in store, i thought it so pretty! it is the over-sized style, when i tried it on, it so flattering, even though it is over-sized but it does not make you look chunky at all! i got it while it was on sale with extra 25% off! i range from 2 to 6, xs, s for retailer sizes. i got a xs for this top.
1719	0	a	I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
1720	1	a	Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!
1721	1	a	This sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail. the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though. if you have a chest, it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i do not mind it for a comfy, cozy, soft sweater.
1722	1	a	Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice, i am a sucker for flowers, i also love the cut of it, teh tiered hem is very flatering, not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra, and the whole dress is super flowey, substantial amterial, and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom, gives it a nice shape). i ca not say anything bad about this. regular xs fit me but i would ahve t
1723	1	a	This is a beautiful, richly-colored top. fits well. very pleased. only negative is the button is covered in same material & can be easily nicked with your fingernail.
1724	1	a	This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic, soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece , but the pink detail on the trim, along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.
1725	1	a	"I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5"" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as"
1726	1	a	I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints, i think it a lot of fun. not so fun to put on, but it worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p, but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.
1727	1	a	It very beautifully designed, simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it did not disappoint me because everything else is so good.
1728	1	a	This will be a 3 season dress for me.. its well made, comfy and flattering . the suede skirt is risky i know .. but i'll be sure to put the napkin in my lap!
1729	1	a	This is a soft, comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular t-shirt - not dressy, but a little more put together looking. it also does not wrinkle, so it my go-to travel shirt for warmer months.
1730	0	a	I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
1731	1	a	I am a shopper....i shop a lot. this is one of my favorite dresses of all time! so unique, and, as others have said, like a piece of art! the fit is tight through the middle but that what makes it look so perfect. i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike. i love it!
1732	1	a	I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!
1733	0	a	"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"", 140lbs, 36d, 39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
1734	1	a	Very cute but true it very sheer. good with a simple nude tube underneath to avoid bra straps showing. i got in both colors. great with slim pants or jeans. may need to order up a size if long torso like me. the small was a bit short.
1735	0	a	The material is soft and the pattern is pretty, but it fits like a sack. it too bad that this was not more form-fitting, with some stretch and a zipper, because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall, very slender ladies, this will be pretty, as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top), but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
1736	1	a	This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.i invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.and the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de
1737	0	a	I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it very unforgiving, clingy, and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time, i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it going back.
1738	1	a	This jacket is gorgeous! the design is visually very interesting. the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day.
1739	1	a	"The sweater looked different on each model so i was not sure what to expect. luckily, it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would, the cream sweater model. i'm 5'6"" and got a size small. i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves. also, the v-neck is not too low so i do not have to wear a camisole.it very cozy and does not itch."
1740	1	a	I loved this but it made my stomach look a lot bigger then it is. i would recommend going up a size in it
1741	1	a	"This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a."
1742	1	a	Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering, but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered,but you may risk losing the flare, which is unfortunate considering the price.
1743	1	a	I did not realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it very cute; just not for me. i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!
1744	1	a	Love this skirt - it looks precisely as the photo depicts. the metallic stitching may be a little bothersome for some in terms of itching/scratching. i&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; 135# and the 6 fit perfectly (pear/hourglass).
1745	1	a	After missing out on last year similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!
1746	1	a	I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it! when my usual size 2 was unavailable, i sized down to a 0 because it looked plenty big and it fits fine. i bought the ivory color and love it! i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts. it a lovely shade of ivory, quite flattering. boxy tops are often not for me, but this one is perfect!
1747	1	a	Wonderful print and color. dress style is very boxy and oversized, fabric is great but has no drape.
1748	1	a	This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!
1749	1	a	It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!it is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature.
1750	1	a	I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.
1751	1	a	I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it would not have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i ca not, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a
1752	1	a	"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right."
1753	0	a	This is more of a sleep shirt. the fabric is too thin and see through. a camisole would not look good under it.will be returning it.
1754	1	a	This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.
1755	1	a	This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of.
1756	1	a	"This dress is great but extremely short. i'm 5'6"" wear a size 4/6. the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short."
1757	0	a	While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
1758	1	a	Perfect fall top! extra long sleeves perfect for keeping the chill off.
1759	1	a	First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas, but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall, if you're considering this jacket, take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.
1760	1	a	Gorgeous top! very beautiful and easy. can be dressed up for work or just worn with a pair of jeans. note the fabric is semi sheer so a nude bra or cami is a must with this but it going to be fantastic for summer!
1761	1	a	"I ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday. my expectations were exceeded. the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout. the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all - for this type of skirt, you need a thicker fabric. i'm about 5'4"", 123lbs and i ordered a 2 regular. the fit - everything from the length to how it fell on the hips, is perfect. ca not wait to wear this skirt!"
1762	0	a	This dress is beautiful, made with high-quality fabric, unique design and color, etc.but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal, but i just could not make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on, the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long, and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall, s
1763	1	a	"I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person. i am 5'7"" 126 lbs and bought the medium. it is more fitted than how it is on the model. it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable. i'm glad i have it!"
1764	1	a	When i first put this dress on, i immediately thought...oh no, i ca not pull this off. at least, not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe
1765	1	a	Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you do not see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!
1766	1	a	I'm in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i'm so glad i purchased it, it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures, but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it, but glad i did not. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high, and it probably would not have shown. the wool material is very fine, not scratchy, and a bit stretchy
1767	1	a	The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.
1768	1	a	Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?
1769	1	a	These jeans did not fit like i thought , based on the model. i usually wear 25 , but these were snug and i i have snug jeans , lots of them and i wanted looser , flared jeans ,kind of a 60 look. not these. a bigger size would not have improved it . they are a perfectly good jean , love the color but not what i wanted .
1770	1	a	I bought this in both colors,for it is perfect for me.it looks great with jeans and then dress it up later with pants.this is why i love retailer!
1771	1	a	I bought this in the dark gray and it got a lot of blue undertones to it. it beautiful and flattering in my regular size, not too fitted -- not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough. i'll take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed. this fabric is so delicate i'm afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water. it a gorgeous piece and i'm happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season.
1772	0	a	I love the back detail but does not feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
1773	1	a	"Tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured (length is similar on me at 5'7"", colors as shown, cut is loose but not overly sacklike). my normal size s fit loosely, but not in an unflattering way. sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders. the embroidery seemed to be good quality, but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining. i would have liked to see a liner at this price (and probably would have bought), but i think i'll wait for a promo or sale"
1774	1	a	I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.
1775	1	a	I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer
1776	1	a	...there enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down
1777	0	a	The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
1778	0	a	I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned, it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.
1779	1	a	Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.
1780	0	a	Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.
1781	0	a	This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.
1782	1	a	The great thing about a swing dress is that it does not cling to the curves. this one is the same way. i got the geometric print. the colors are fun. i would have gone down to the small just to loose some of the material on this dress if it had not fit across so tight across the back. if you have no bust, i would say size down two sizes or try a petite. the dress has a breathable fabric so great for summer wear. the only cons are the large armpits and extra fabric but sizing down should help.
1783	1	a	Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.
1784	1	a	"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket, but do agree that it more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but, i live in california, so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it"
1785	0	a	The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle, then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality, but not practical.
1786	1	a	Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the 4 fit
1787	1	a	I'm not sure what cup size i am, 36b or 36c, but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely wo not be wearing it out in public, but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops, but the medium worked for those too.
1788	1	a	The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!
1789	1	a	I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.
1790	1	a	These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.
1791	1	a	At the beginning of summer, i first ordered one of these tops in size xl. i liked the colors and the material was such a soft, open weave. i thought it would be perfect for the hot weather so i ordered a 2nd on sale. unfortunately, even though these are made of mesh, these tops ended up being really hot. i wore them in texas, new york, new jersey, and florida. i thought they'd be a good, pretty choice. but, the material with the gathered waist & wrists, trapped in the heat. it was just too sheer
1792	1	a	I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it.
1793	1	a	This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i could not wait to put it. once i put it on, i could not wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.
1794	1	a	"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer, i have this in a small and it fits perfectly, fits snug when zipped, my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!"
1795	1	a	This top is my go-to running errands top on the weekends, its super comfy and not to warm to wear throughout all the seasons. runs true to size and i get a bunch of compliments on the quality!
1796	1	a	"I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that do not need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room."
1797	1	a	This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i ca not wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.
1798	1	a	This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.
1799	0	a	It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
1800	1	a	I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.
1801	1	a	The color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person. the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i'd imagined from the photos. it has a quilted quality so does not drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms. i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large. i think a medium might have been better. have not decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return. has an artsy, cool professor vibe that i like.
1802	1	a	I wore this to my retirement party; i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event. i wanted something that was dressy, while also being unique so i would not look like everyone else. almost without exception, from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with, mentioned my dress. the design is so unique, making me feel even more special on my special day. it beautiful, yet comfortable. the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort. really a fun dress to wear. i'm sure
1803	1	a	I love these. the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading. since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black. perfect wait and not to giant, and perfect for year round work. the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous.
1804	1	a	I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.
1805	1	a	This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i ca not wait!
1806	1	a	"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature"
1807	0	a	I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:( really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine. i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women. the only complaint is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!
1808	1	a	I'm one of those people who is juuuust right between being regular and petite sized, so i have a hard time with some longer tunic styles. this tee is pretty fitted though the shoulders and bust, which makes the rest of the top kind of skim over the body. i like that, especially for those days where i feel a little bloated or like i want to hide out a bit. the fabric is very comfortable and not sheer. the little stripe down the back is a cute detail and it in a slightly contrasting fabric w
1809	1	a	Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.
1810	1	a	This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it on sale.
1811	0	a	Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
1812	1	a	The sweater is very soft. it has an interesting pattern. i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts. it definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter.
1813	1	a	"I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank. i usually wear a large in retailer tops. this top fit a bit loose. there is a bit more space around the armholes. this only concerns me because i ca not wear a bra or cami without it showing. just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller. i am 68, around 5/5"" and weight 144 lbs. love the young, modern tops that i find at retailer. i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit (btw, there is a"
1814	1	a	I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're
1815	1	a	I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality, but pricey for what it is. it more like a $45 sweater not $100+
1816	0	a	The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.also, the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.needed to return
1817	1	a	Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work, but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.
1818	1	a	This sheath is extremely well-made, and the fabric is even more vibrant and beautiful than it looks in the photos. my only complaint: it does run a little small in the bodice. my usual size 4 fit like a dream everywhere but the top, which borders on uncomfortably snug. for reference, i'm a full 34b.
1819	1	a	"I ran into retailer to actually return a dress and saw this hanging in the petite section and had to try it. at almost 5'4"" i can sometimes go between regular and petite sizing. and thankfully i could grab the petite with this dress. (they did not have the regular size) it airy and summery, i love the design of the swing. it loose, but not tent like. the length came to about 3 inches above my knee. it not see though at all! i had black bottoms on and you could not see them. another plus it tha"
1820	1	a	I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!
1821	1	a	I would buy these in every color! they're incredibly soft and stylish and feel like wearing pj in public!
1822	1	a	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.2. it comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.4. i did not like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.5. i also did not like the mustard color. it unflattering to me."
1823	1	a	This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small, fitting as it does on the model. it a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t
1824	1	a	This dress i received is stylish, comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length, goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i ca not say enough about this dress as i ca not wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!
1825	0	a	I love the style of this dress, but unfortunately, it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also, the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.
1826	1	a	Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it. keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the
1827	1	a	I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering, slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft , medium weight sweater- very versatile. love
1828	1	a	Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i do not even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion.
1829	1	a	I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever had. the fit is amazing and wish they were not sold out online or i would buy more!
1830	1	a	Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
1831	0	a	I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be.
1832	1	a	Beautiful dress, stretch material makes sure it fits the figure nicely. great value.
1833	1	a	I am 4ft 11and 114 lbs. and i tried on the regular 0 and 2. the 2 fit better but there was too much extra material in the back so i order the 2 petite. the 2 petite fit perfectly, very classic in the front with the right amount of flow in the back. i ca not wait to wear this to work or out to dinner with the girls.
1834	1	a	First, my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice, but stiff, so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting, but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me, not up to the usual ms standard.
1835	1	a	I honestly, have to give these jeans 5stars. i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them, i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too! i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange. these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but, if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.
1836	1	a	"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is"
1837	1	a	I first saw this top earlier in the year. i watched for it to go on sale and it finally did over the labor day holiday + 40% off. i was very happy about that. it runs a tiny bit big. i got the s. i wonder if the xs would have been better but i kept the small because of the price and how cute it looked on. it looks gray online but it is more greenish gray. it has a cute back detail, too. it looks cute with jeans and gray pants. it is just cute and different than most of my other tops.
1838	1	a	I want to say that i love this fabric design, combining some of my favorite colors -- greens and neutrals. however, this just did not work for me:_______pros:- it does have a nice flow as others stated.- pockets are a surprise touch for a silk dress.- the slip inside is detachable._______cons:- as another stated, lots of wrinkles. it the nature of silk unfortunately, which means more work for me. - length is too short in front for my personal liking. trend of these high-low he
1839	0	a	I really wanted to keep this dress, and the material is amazing, so soft and gentle and delicate, the design is great, the front looks nice, but from back looks really awkward, big and kind of too loose!
1840	0	a	The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
1841	1	a	Love this top! it pretty, unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.
1842	1	a	I love this dress, although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person, it a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it does not feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however, the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it a bit strange looking.
1843	1	a	"Ok, here is the story: i am 5'5"", 118 lb, 34c. i got a 4 and a 6, both are s tad tight at the chest and shoulder area, but i have big shoulders; i am keeping the 6. there is plenty material at the waist and below, but the dress does not look frumpy, at least on me it does not. i like the picture with the belt and i will wear it that way too. i also like the sleeves, they make it easier to wear at work. the material is lovely and so is the embroidery and cut-out. it really is a sweet summer dress"
1844	1	a	Bought this dress in store after trying it on. loved it. it sexy with the lower cut front. the fabric is flowy and breathable. runs true to size. usually wear a 10 with my hips but the 8 fit better on top.the sides are well designed so your bra does not show. i'm 5''6' 32g size 29/30 jeans and athletic/hourglass built. i ca not wait to wear it out. the pictures do not do it justice.
1845	1	a	I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however, to my delight, i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online, i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest, wide hips, small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh
1846	0	a	"This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7"", 140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip."
1847	1	a	With the pleats, probably need to tuck in shirt. these were too big for me, so need to return.
1848	0	a	I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it were not so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
1849	1	a	I ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because it wide in the arm holes. but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath. i love that while it sleeveless, the straps are wide. this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top. i do not have that problem so it looks really cute. i also love the length. a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person, shorter tops look best.
1850	1	a	I do not understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i
1851	1	a	I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
1852	1	a	I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it
1853	0	a	This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans, running errands, etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon, and that the problem i think.i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color, hangs nicely, does not cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck, it was a bit l
1854	1	a	Very comfortable to sleep in. does not bunch up or twist. love this.
1855	1	a	Love this dress so much, i bought the checkered, and then had to go back for the black! it is so worth the price. i wear it with sandals in the warm weather, and a blazer with boots in the cooler weather. it is beautiful and so flattering.
1856	1	a	Not for everyone - this coat has an intentional slightly oversized body and sleeves, with a short sleeve length, and a heavy fabric that is perfect for cold california winters (and maybe fall weather everywhere else). the weight comes from what seems to be a lining of a heavy hunter -green-colored neoprene-like substance. it definitely feels substantial and worth the price. a coat like this would look amazing with crisp, clean lines, culottes, joggers, flatforms/clogs, or can transfer into workw
1857	1	a	"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which does not compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the"
1858	1	a	The front cream panel is completely transparent.i did not purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
1859	1	a	So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise, excellent.
1860	1	a	I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
1861	1	a	I love this top. i wear it all the time. the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade. i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.
1862	1	a	I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too.
1863	1	a	Amazingly soft, thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!
1864	1	a	"This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red."
1865	1	a	I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it trendy without trying too hard. nice lines, the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty, i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.
1866	1	a	I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on, but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite, but surprise, it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on, whcich i did yesterday. mistake, because i love it, and even if it is not peite, it workedc (with heels), and online it already says only a few left, so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.cut is very flattering, and colors are great. also can be worn any seas
1867	1	a	What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i ca not wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
1868	1	a	I looooove these pants. i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer. i tried them on and they make my bootie look great. they are also not see through which i love. i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple! ps. they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after 2 wears.
1869	1	a	Loved this top from the moment i saw it. i was bummed that this top was not available in petite sizes, but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself. i purchased the xs. after receiving it and trying it on, it was big under the arms and waist area, i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes. i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect.
1870	1	a	The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.
1871	1	a	Cute cute. simple tank with a little something to add interest.
1872	1	a	I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.
1873	1	a	This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy
1874	1	a	Comfortable fabric and beautiful print! light enough for the summer but is also great for fall.
1875	1	a	This is a beautifu;l dress. unfortunately it runs extremely large. i wear sized 10-12 and ordered l. i was lost in all the material. but because i love this dress so much, i am taking a chance and ordered it in small.
1876	1	a	"Tried the xs in store (and 115 lbs, 30dd, 5'1.5""): fit like a glove, the chest part was fitted on me, the white is almost not see through, but nowadays, that seems acceptable (see though). the material is typical of meadow rue, cotton like, and airy. it is a basic white with styling. the top part also has some dimension, i overall thought this would look nice with my white shorts or with some nice jeans and blazer."
1877	1	a	Cute colored jeans. ordered the sky color & when it arrived, the color was a medium moss green color. the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
1878	1	a	Good quality, fit and length! love them:)
1879	1	a	Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable
1880	1	a	This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!
1881	0	a	I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.
1882	1	a	This is a great up-to-date twist on a must-have staple - a black (or grey) cardigan. easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather.
1883	1	a	For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier, more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
1884	1	a	"This is truly a beautiful dress! the delicate fringe-like fabric throughout makes it unique and and the column silhouette with slight blouse-like top is elegant! perfect for summer with comfortable stretchy slip that comes with the dress! the material on the waist line stretches and is very comfortable. the bottom is pretty narrow so you need to take smaller steps. it does run large, i am 5'3""/135lbs/34b and an xs fit perfect throughout as well as the length! only not so positive feature is how"
1885	1	a	"I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning."
1886	0	a	I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i do not understand the sizing on this at all. it a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
1887	1	a	"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail, but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso, and the regular is laughable for anyone that is not an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!curvy ladies, also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely, the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not, and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
1888	1	a	Love these pilcro jeans, my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs, they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist, not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!
1889	1	a	"An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the ""yes i'm buying right now"" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale, i am buying more colors."
1890	1	a	Top is very wide and flowy. i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering. would be very cute with the right body shape.
1891	1	a	I had not seen this sweater/jacket online or in store before shopping today. i purchased the ivory. it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped. great fit- true to size.the asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail. the pockets are well placed also. it is a perfect spring weight jacket or, i suspect, a comfy fall to winter sweater.
1892	1	a	Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.
1893	1	a	I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for
1894	1	a	Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it not. it definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank did not match the top.
1895	1	a	"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but could not manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny."
1896	1	a	Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.
1897	1	a	I bought this top for my sister birthday so the review is based on her opinion. she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful. she said it was tts. she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down.
1898	0	a	I never write reviews, but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it not a have to have top just to look at it, but once i put it on i had to have it. it extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together. i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a
1899	1	a	This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however.
1900	1	a	Loved the idea of these as soon as i saw them! great mid weight jean. a little large in the waist. the rhinestones sparkle and i received tons of complements when i wore these jeans! great dressed up or down!
1901	1	a	I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu
1902	1	a	I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it so soft, fits tts & i just ca not wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!
1903	1	a	I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it was not too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i have not washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.
1904	1	a	"I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this ""cardigan"" has sleeves but actually it a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it also quite short, i'm only 5 5"" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but"
1905	0	a	"I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.it runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there a little slip that goes with the dress, w"
1906	1	a	Very pretty sweater! i love the bell sleeves with the design on the sides. the sweater runs a bit short though and wish it hung a little longer. looks great with flare jeans and boots!
1907	1	a	"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile."
1908	0	a	I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it? it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.
1909	1	a	I do not understand how a couple people gave this a bad review. i loved this jacket from the minute i tried it on. cute in the picture and cuter on, because it is so comfortable. the fabric is super soft and does not wrinkle (as one reviewer stated). i took it on the plane with me just to keep warm and it was fabulous. looked as good going on the plane as it did coming off. the drape of the jacket flows nicely and i love the oversized pockets to stash my phone or lipstick. this jacket will carry
1910	0	a	"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it did not fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i"
1911	1	a	These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.
1912	0	a	I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i could not get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel is not accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning.
1913	1	a	This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy, cool weather!! the white one goes with everything, and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy, quality mater
1914	1	a	Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.
1915	1	a	This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.
1916	1	a	I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!
1917	1	a	I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6, 137lbs, 34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i did not buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it 30% i might spring for it, regardless of the weird cut. it super cute otherwise!
1918	1	a	I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
1919	1	a	Stretch out fast5,8 130lb i order size 26 which is my usually size. they fit prefect for about 3hr and then stretched out feeling not right on my body. maybe i should have gone down a sizes. even so i feel like the $$$ and quality do not add up but they are very soft and comfortable, i would not buy them again.
1920	0	a	I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color. i did not have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark. cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants are not every day wearable and washable!
1921	1	a	This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!
1922	0	a	My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back. that should have been a clue that this dress is not meant to fit anyone properly if it does not fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long. you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr
1923	1	a	Unfortunately had to return this. i loved it but just does not work for my petite size.
1924	0	a	I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
1925	1	a	Another beautiful mave piece!! that is too big!! waiting for the size down to come in the mail. fingers crossed this works. the large was too overwhelming on my 5'6 frame. the tank that comes with it is soft and comfy and the gold accents really make this an outstanding number!! too bad no petite is offered. i ordered the black but it was hard to choose because the white also looks amazing. i predict lots of cooing over this lovely!!
1926	1	a	This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!
1927	1	a	This is my favorite dress i've bought in the past year! it is super flattering and can be worn for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and comfortable. ca not wait till the weather gets warmer so i can start wearing it regularly!i'm 5'5 145lbs, 37-29-39. i got the medium petite and it fits perfectly!
1928	0	a	"Like a previous reviewer, i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots, so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really did not work on me. i normally wear a small in tops, however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t"
1929	1	a	I ordered a size up after reading the reviews, but i would not of had to. it not a snug fit at all. although, i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands.
1930	1	a	This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue, and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine, just larger and even more roomy), but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans, flats, leather boots, o
1931	1	a	I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny, but this blouse is cut correctly for it size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down. .the neckline is really beautiful and unique, and the shirt material is soft. the front is a very pale lavender, and the sleeves and back of the blouse are gray. there is a pale lavender lining fo
1932	0	a	Great color, soft fabric, but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
1933	0	a	I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
1934	0	a	Super large and a very weird cut. the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
1935	1	a	Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric. love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.with various necklaces this top has limitless options! the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f
1936	1	a	As soon as i saw this blouse in the store, i fell in love with it. i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was, but, hey, that antho for you. i luckily had a gift card and a 15% off bday promo, so i got it at a good discount. i love the fit of it. sometimes button-down tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest, and this one does not. when i do wear it, i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when
1937	1	a	Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.
1938	0	a	Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it quite wide. i also did not like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
1939	0	a	"I love the maeve line and was excited to get this dress. unfortunately, the fit was just bad. the top fit fine but the bottom half was too snug and there were unattractive gaps around the waist and the pockets. do not think another size or tailoring would address the issue. for size, i am 5'4"", 130 and ordered the 6."
1940	0	a	These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort, they are a five. but after only two wearings, they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price, i'd be more upset.
1941	1	a	A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through
1942	1	a	This is a really great bathing suit top. i have not purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette
1943	1	a	This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally do not wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.
1944	1	a	Definitely shorter than expected, but a super light, airy, and comfy dress for summer nights. a must for summer dinner parties!!!
1945	0	a	This is one fabulous-looking dress; however, the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up, to see if that would help, but it was still too scratchy for me.
1946	1	a	"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that when you know you scored."
1947	0	a	One ca not tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length. feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
1948	1	a	A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.
1949	1	a	I love this dress! it super comfortable--soft fabric and does not bind anywhere--yet somehow it still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also, it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots, tights, a long-sleeved black t-shirt, etc.).
1950	1	a	I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal.
1951	1	a	I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt, lined, good length...just above the knee, and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up, flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small, but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e
1952	1	a	"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and ordered an xs. it hits at my knees & is loose fitting, but not tent like."
1953	1	a	Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.
1954	1	a	I love the design of this top. the pattern is beautiful and the back unique. i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage. i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure. i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.
1955	1	a	This was a splurge piece for my fall wardrobe. however, i will be returning it. it extremely heavy and bulky. the collar does not lay right--it tall so it wants to flop over but it too bulky to fold and stay down. i went a size down and the sleeves are huge--wide and too long. it not flattering on my figure--i have a booty but the sweater does not show curves at all. i also thought the colors were dingy, not bright like the photo. i think it would look good on someone tall and slender (als
1956	0	a	I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
1957	0	a	"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
1958	1	a	This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.
1959	1	a	I thought this shirt was really interesting online and it does not disappoint in person. i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher. overall though this was a great find and i know i'll wear it again and again.
1960	1	a	"Went to the store in search of a butter dish. tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable, versatile and all over appealing this dress is. i'm 5'10"" and the medium hits at my knees. as always i think the quality could be better. it not something that will last for years."
1961	1	a	I love everything about this jumper - it so comfortable without being too warm. it easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.
1962	1	a	I love this top! it is modest enough for work, but fun enough for weekends. soft, comfortable, and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors, though.)soft flowy fabric, is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!
1963	1	a	Love love this sweater vest! quality is wonderful and the fit is great. highly recommend!
1964	0	a	I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
1965	1	a	I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!
1966	1	a	"Definitely a great silhouette. overall, it just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said, it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-12 on the bottom (5'7"" --- 35"" 28"" 41""!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress, but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely, my shoulders are petite, so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m"
1967	1	a	This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.
1968	1	a	This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute, but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med, 34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm.
1969	1	a	This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising, (i probably did not read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. ca not wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning, it also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;)
1970	1	a	This blouse runs large, billows out slightly, and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty, the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless, i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it light weight.
1971	1	a	I normally do not care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.
1972	0	a	"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however, on me, they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste, and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus, back they went. for reference, i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6."
1973	1	a	Bought the green/blue - colors are bright, fabric is so soft. the neckline is just right for a small chest. the top is structured nicely, giving you a figure flattering fit.
1974	0	a	Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i do not think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.
1975	1	a	"I ordered this in black and loved it so much, i ordered the 'red' color too. it has not arrived yet, but i'm hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5'3"" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and was not too long."
1976	1	a	"Seriously the best jeans i have bought in years - better than my favorite paige and ag stevies. i sized down from a 27tall to a 26tall and they still are not super tight, i think maybe some could even go down 2 sizes - i do still have a lot of room in the waist but i am pretty straight through the hips. i am almost 5'10 with long legs and the tall is a great ankle length and fits me like the model. wonderful stretch, comfy, great color and awesome ""ageing."" i do not normally like the ripped jean l"
1977	1	a	All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i was not sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or
1978	1	a	This is why i shop at retailer. i was in one of my local stores recently, mainly to check out the sale. my boyfriend was with me. we had not been in the store 5 minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees. this one caught my eye. the color, omg! and then flowers and butterflies! try it on, he said, as i held one up. no..... i should not. we wandered around, checked out the sale and all the new. and i was back at that table looking at that tee. so, i took a small and an xs to the fitting
1979	1	a	...for real, reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.
1980	1	a	Soft material, lays nicely. got an xs but usually wear a smaill. got it in the mail and it is wrinkly so will need to steam it.
1981	1	a	Loving the ombrﾃ｣ﾂｩ color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.
1982	1	a	"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared"
1983	1	a	Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.
1984	1	a	Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!
1985	1	a	"I was lucky to get these on sale with free shipping(my major lucky shopping moment of the year); however, they are worth every penny of the full price. i've waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans, but now my skeptical opinion has done a 180 turn. these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim i've ever tried. they look and feel fabulous on me. i bought my usual 29/size 6 and am 5'1"", 130#."
1986	1	a	"I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really does not do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu"
1987	1	a	I have this top in 3 colors and am waiting for the black to arrive. very soft on the body. we live in fl so lightweight is appreciated. stylish fit that is not ordinary. great colors. will pack well and can be dressed up with a scarf. sleeves run long.
1988	1	a	Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch, fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined, but great for weather in 50-low 60 with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look, wish the pockets were just a bit bigger, i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it a keeper.i ordered m/l and am usually a medium or la
1989	1	a	Very pretty skirt, makes me feel very feminine and makes my waist look smaller than it is.
1990	1	a	"I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their ""size"" to judge clothes. go up or down if it does not fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly."
1991	1	a	"Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5"" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs"
1992	1	a	This dress is super cute, flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i'll get lots of wear out of it.
1993	1	a	"Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is, with a cardi, denim jacket, leggings/tights and boots, etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4, particularly in the chest (i'm 34a), and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5'7""). the neckline is cut somewhat low, but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (do not feel need for cami). very"
1994	1	a	I just could not resist the western scene and it does not disappoint. i ordered size large and although it a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric is not thin or heavy. was not it goldilicks who said: it just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,
1995	1	a	I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i was not crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i do not really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale.
1996	0	a	I loved this top when i saw it online, and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately, the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small, and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest, i do not think a petite would work for me. such a cute top, but it just wo not work for me.
1997	0	a	I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite, but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
1998	1	a	I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!
1999	1	a	"This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5"",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make"
2000	1	a	Obsessed with these pants. i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale ! great fit very comfortable
2001	1	a	"I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4"" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors."
2002	1	a	The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.
2003	1	a	If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it surprisingly fun to wear.
2004	1	a	This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.
2005	1	a	I'm a 32dd, so i would not normally wear a bralette out of the house (not enough support). this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable. i'm probably going to get at least one more. for reference, i'm a 32dd (small back, big boobs) and a small fit me extremely well.
2006	1	a	I am torn about this top. on the one hand, it is beautiful in all aspects:flattering cutbeautiful detail at neck, victorian necklineivory color, flattering on most skin tones, including my very pale skinspeck of gold in fabric, it is lines with gold threadbummers: it is see-through, as in you can see through the neck part. the picture online shows a more covered look, i think the model ash a shirt underneath. on me, you really see the skin through. so i will have to try with a nude b
2007	1	a	I like the grey pattern and black and white contrast versions the best! very soft and falls nicely on my bust. the biggest differences wit the sizes are on length, so i ordered up for it would be a bit longer. it a great piece.
2008	1	a	Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.
2009	1	a	These jeans are one of my all time favorite ag jeans. comfortable denim, dark rinse. wide cuffs are fashionable but still classy. wear them all the time!
2010	0	a	As a tall girl, i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however, as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony, the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really do not see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!
2011	1	a	I love this top, but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath. as the pic shows, the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place... kinda odd placement in my opinion. but if you do not mind the sheerness or a cami, it a great top.
2012	1	a	These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.
2013	1	a	"Bought this sweater on sale off the website. it fits perfectly - nice length. as some others said, a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable - just need to wear a cami or tee underneath. the collar is a nice shape. fabric is a little stiffer than it ""looks"" in the photos."
2014	0	a	"Crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around. the waist section, where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and did not lay well. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs, 32c, 26"" waist, and 32"" hip usually wear a 0 or extra small in the maeve clothing that is not a fitted style. i bought the s, which fit well except for the waist issue described above. this is a fitted dress. i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received. it is a great style idea."
2015	1	a	"I bought these pants expecting to lounge around the house in them. but once i tried them on, they were so figure flattering that i wore them to an outdoor dinner party (paired with a black tank top, silver accessories, and wedges) and got compliments galore. i still wear them to lounge in (they are super comfy) but they are also my emergency ""oh we're going out tonight, honey?"" pants. the only downside is that they need ironing when you pop them out of the wash (unless you are using them to loun"
2016	1	a	Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.
2017	1	a	I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.
2018	1	a	These are nice, flattering bra with light to medium suport. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra. exmaple: on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange. on the bra i received the left side is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right side is orange and light purple. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block shorts as we
2019	1	a	I love this jacket. it is stylish, yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear. the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun, and, the fitted cut flatters your shape.
2020	1	a	So soft, high quality, perfect poncho sweater that will go with every pair of jeans you have. love!
2021	0	a	Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.
2022	0	a	"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show"
2023	1	a	My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white, yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft, it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts, jeans and leggings.
2024	1	a	Gorgeous colors, great neckline (can be worn off one shoulder), the slits on the side allow for wear as tunic or as half tucked. very cute.
2025	1	a	Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i do not mind because they are perfect!
2026	1	a	I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.
2027	1	a	Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist
2028	1	a	"I was not sure how this dress would be sized, so i ordered it in two different sizes and kept the smaller one. i would say it does run a little bit large, but not much.i agree with other reviewers that the dress came kind of wrinkled, but overall the dress is like it was pictured. i think that this dress might be better for taller women - i am 5'8"", and i think it fits well, but i could see how it would not be flattering if i were much shorter. overall, i am excited to wear this!"
2029	1	a	"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!"
2030	1	a	"I followed everyone advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 32 inch waist, but size 10 (and 30 in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 12 in this skirt, and it fits perfect. it form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out, but i'm curvy. if you are straighter, it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf, so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. the fabric is soft, but has no stretch. it 100% cotton. there is a"
2031	1	a	I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.
2032	1	a	Fit was very tts. it looks more lightweight in the photo than it is in person, it a fairly medium weight sweater. i'm 5'8 and curvy, and it is nowhere near as long on me in the front as it is on the model. i still liked the look, mostly because of the look from the back of the shirt.
2033	1	a	This is a great transition piece. wear with jeans or dress it up with a cute skirt.
2034	1	a	I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.
2035	1	a	I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!
2036	1	a	I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!
2037	1	a	I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other 2 baily 44 dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 125 pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 44 dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally do not think it too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
2038	1	a	I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just did not suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it calling your name.
2039	0	a	"This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
2040	1	a	I really liked the top once i saw it, but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine, but it is a nice top.
2041	1	a	This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.
2042	1	a	Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.
2043	1	a	Following another reviewer advice, i ordered up to an xl. it huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it a one of a kind piece. soft, lightweight, yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.
2044	1	a	"Bought this in navy - going to buy another one in a different color! it fits my curves beautifully! does not look ""boxy"" like other tunic sweaters. i also disagree with other reviews, i cannot see through it."
2045	1	a	The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.
2046	0	a	The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just was not going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i do not like it enough to try.
2047	1	a	This blouse is perfect in so many ways: it cotton, the fit is super flattering, the design is gorgeous. i never, and i mean never, wear red, but i made an exception here due to the exceptionally stunning embroidery. i know this will be comfortable this summer; the fit is slightly loose, so the air can flow. the cotton is light but not thin, no cami needed. a medium size fits me very well; i am size 8/medium top, 34f, 130#. i love that the armholes are high and hide any flaws. the button design
2048	1	a	This top is lovely. it got a decent length to it, so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt. the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy, which can sometimes cause it to slip/sag off the shoulder -- not entirely off, but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of off-shoulder look! it very flattering if you tuck it in, or even if you do not. i got this top in red, and it lovely --a little more towards than coral side than crimson.
2049	1	a	I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.
2050	1	a	It a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!
2051	0	a	This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.
2052	0	a	The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.
2053	1	a	This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.it looks and feels like really good quality.
2054	0	a	The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it come to that.
2055	1	a	In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.
2056	1	a	Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
2057	1	a	I love this jacket. the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture. as far as sizing goes, i'm usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well. i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste. the small gives me a more fitted look.
2058	1	a	"Stunning! i got about 6 compliments the day i wore it. 2 different men i barely know said ""you're really rocking that outfit."" i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big (i'm 5'3"" 106 lbs) but i kept it anyway since i'm both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats. i paired with a denim shirt- perfection."
2059	1	a	I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i did not like the material of blouse.
2060	0	a	Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
2061	1	a	I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i have not worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac
2062	1	a	Love this dress. wear it with sneakers or boots. can add a belt, or the right accessories to dress it up.
2063	1	a	Ladies do not let this beauty get away. never paid much attention to it on-line but went into local retailer today and it was returned by someone. i could not get it on fast enough. it is gorgeous. runs tts. i took the small, for reference i am 36c top and petite. this will work on any body type. you wo not be sorry. well worth the money for the style and fabric.
2064	0	a	It rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec
2065	1	a	This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it lined with the softest faux fur), it quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they did not cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. ca not wait till the weather g
2066	0	a	"This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it boxy and does not hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale."
2067	1	a	Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.
2068	1	a	This is a beautiful skirt that is extremely well made.
2069	0	a	This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom, which normally i like, but not this time. sad.
2070	0	a	Darling jacket/coat, similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one, but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.
2071	1	a	Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me.
2072	0	a	I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
2073	0	a	Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.
2074	1	a	It impossible to tell, but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy. the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman, with a sharp cut (that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind). the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in, but i went ahead with a strapless. the back has a neat square cut. the skirt is slightly longer, on both sides, which gives the dress movement, even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut. i wore it
2075	1	a	I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird
2076	0	a	The waist is a little high and large, and this causes gapping in the small-of-the-back area. very cute dress, if it fit well. would probably work on someone less curvy. 00p, 5'4'',110lbs,32c for reference.
2077	0	a	Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area, waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
2078	0	a	Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
2079	1	a	I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.
2080	1	a	Absolutely beautiful, i am extremely happy with this purchase. i bought this top a couple of months ago and have worn it many times. initially, i was a little apprehensive to order due to some of the other reviews but i found that this top is very figure flattering. it is very soft and warm and i am positive it will be in my wardrobe for quite a few years to come. i am almost sad that i will have to put it away for the season soon.
2081	1	a	I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.
2082	1	a	I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!
2083	1	a	As others have said, this dress does run large. i ordered the xxs petite, and ti isalmsot big on me (hips are wide, so at least, it is comfortable in width). material is a bit scratchier than i am used to s well.color is great, and it looks nice when i see it on my stylist, who convinced me to hold on to it for a little... thinking about it.my zipepr was also a little hard to work.shorter than some other dresses...
2084	1	a	This robe is warm, soft and i like how long it is! it perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!
2085	1	a	So soft, light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful, with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside, even though it just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s, which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.
2086	1	a	This shirt is awesome. i absolutely love the style of this shirt! it super flowy, and is a really breathable fabric. i've been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants. the only downside is the quality of material. it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills. it also feels like it going to start falling apart at the arm seams. nonetheless, i adore the shirt, and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season! no
2087	1	a	"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#."
2088	0	a	"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut, but unfortunately, the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily, and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store, and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it, but i ca not justify keeping it because this wo not last"
2089	1	a	I adore this sweater! is it a bit itchy? yes. do i care? certainly not enough to send it back. great length, hangs nicely. unique without being gaudy. great purchase.
2090	1	a	This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!
2091	1	a	I purchased the blue version in store. it a nice royal blue, not navy. (although the it could be worn with navy.) i thought the fit was flattering. the middle piece (pleat?) is less obvious on the blue than the purple. the tie at the neck can be untied and it is still not too low cut.
2092	1	a	Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned
2093	1	a	"Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6"" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium."
2094	1	a	My new favorite socks! has a grip and does not slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.
2095	1	a	Yes, it a swing top, just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me, being top heavy, so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge, with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top, which the photo does not seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.
2096	0	a	I'm disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors are not as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit is not good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo
2097	0	a	The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. ca not wear this again.
2098	1	a	The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined, except for the sleeves, which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter, so wearing this on a hot day wo not work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it roomy, straight, and quite flowy. i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it just like the picture. it hits below the knee.
2099	1	a	More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.
2100	0	a	This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
2101	0	a	This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.
2102	1	a	Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!
2103	0	a	As other reviewers have noted, the fit of this tee is very boxy. it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans, but otherwise is unflattering. also, the color is described as black, but mine looks like a navy blue in person. i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult, but if able to, i would have returned it.
2104	1	a	"Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy."
2105	1	a	Love everything about the dress! my only issue is when i washed it (cold water and hand wash cycle) is shrank about a half a size. i only washed the inner slip portion and let it air dry as well. so its fits a little snug, but fortunately the outer part is very flowy so it does not look too tight!!
2106	1	a	This tee is s bit on the pricey side but well with it. soft fabric, and unique mix beautiful colors (i got the grey, blush, and gold) that will offer a lot of options on terms of what it can be worn with. i love splendid and this tee is why i do!
2107	0	a	This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it the perfect weight and not too low cut, and that the buttons are covered. however, the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i did not even wash the shirt yet. sadly, i do not think i can recommend this shirt, though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body, but it still looks great. i hope this helps!
2108	1	a	This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it so gorgeous, i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it a dynam
2109	0	a	I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab, poorly-made, too-small sweater. the knit material was not good quality and the overall fit did not work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock, then i would have overlooked the problems. but, there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
2110	1	a	This top is a lot more striking in person. on, it quite stunning. it is a tad short but that part of the aesthetic and i do not find it unflattering. however, the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate, but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath
2111	0	a	I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.
2112	1	a	I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it long enough!
2113	1	a	Bypassed this blouse online, but it striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. do not hesitate to buy, it a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..
2114	1	a	I've received so many complements on this top. it so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color. i ordered it in each color!
2115	1	a	This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i do not like about it, is the three buttons in the back at the top are very, very difficult to button.
2116	1	a	The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.
2117	1	a	Love these.they are a lovely gauzey cotton so they actually feel light. they do have volume however i do not believe they make you look bulkier though i suppose that depends on body type and how they are styled on top (i first wore with a form-fitting sleeveless chambray button down). that said, i sized down which meant the waistband was really too snug and so i sewed the button over to allow more room, which is why i gave them four stars. they have an elegant retro feel, versatile for spring and
2118	1	a	Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i could not find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it.
2119	1	a	I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped.the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true
2120	1	a	"I am 5""7"" and weigh 123 lbs. i tried on both these dresses in medium, and they both fit. they are not too thin, not too high slit, not scratchy. the problem is i am middle aged with a thick waist. the waist looked lumpy with the close fit knit. if you are younger, slim and tall, you will love it. i sent it back with regrets. hope this helps."
2121	0	a	This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
2122	1	a	"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i do not t"
2123	1	a	"This super cute sweater is comfy and fun to wear. i love it as much as last years wool paned sweater tunic, except this sweater is too short on me to wear as a dress. wonderful with leggings and boots. i bought the blue in size m regular and my stats are: 63""t/39""c/28""w/35""h/30""i (tall/chest/waist/hips/inseam)"
2124	1	a	This dress is so pretty!! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it. make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress' design.
2125	1	a	Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.
2126	0	a	"I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however, in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt, at least on me. it was oddly shapeless, even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
2127	0	a	Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just did not fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just did not make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i'm not. going back.
2128	1	a	I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i do not often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq
2129	1	a	I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it so much better in person than on-line. it true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.
2130	1	a	"I love these pants. these pants are perfect if you like a slim style, but ca not comfortably wear skinnies. i like the heavy weight corduroy fabric and seaming details. i bought the ""wine"" color, but as pictured, it really is rust or copper colored, which i prefer."
2131	0	a	I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i do not think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.
2132	1	a	George venson of vousta has designed a pair of pajama bottoms that are beautifully designed & comfy to lounge & sleep in. they are a light weight flannel that fit true to size & wash extremely well. the design on these pj are like no other; a white background with red birds. polar bears, deer, all with tree branches running through the length of the pant. they're just delightful. you must try them!
2133	1	a	This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it flattering and looks great with jeans.
2134	0	a	"I noticed this top on one of the sales associates, and it looked great. she probably 230lbs and about 5'5. tried it on and it looked horrible, i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8"" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material, it is light, and summery."
2135	1	a	I am in love with this dress. ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 (i go back and forth) and this time i kept the six. there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe. i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it appropriate for work and for an evening out.
2136	1	a	Beautiful! color is true to pictures. no stretch. no liner. looks good with white or nude tank.
2137	1	a	I love these tees, i ordered 2 of the map shirt. they are comfortable and stylish. i knew that i would wear it so much, so i bought a spare.
2138	1	a	I bought the black version of this dress. looks exactly like the picture and is true to size.
2139	1	a	"Do not know why but i did not have high expectations for this dress. turns out it uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett"
2140	1	a	This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style, quality, and color is incredible. highly recommend, even at this price. you wo not regret it.
2141	0	a	I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
2142	1	a	I purchased this dress before reading any of the reviews. i ended up reading them the day the dress was to arrive---and they worried me, since i was so excited for this dress! i put it on and i feel like it is not much different from the photo here online. it is meant to be roomy. it is more fitted on top, and the back is cute to give it some shape too. but it is meant to be loose fitting. i personally love it. i have added a belt to give it more shape when i want, worn it on its own, or with a
2143	0	a	Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!
2144	1	a	I love the details of this top: the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering, especially if you have a tummy. the arm holes are not gaping like so many tops, so you do not even need a cami underneath to hide your bra. it is a bit on the larger side. i often wear a large, but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small.
2145	1	a	This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i do not think a bra can be worn with it which i do not mind at all but might be a problem for others.
2146	1	a	This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model. the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color. i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did! perfect dress for work and going out. the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo.
2147	1	a	I loved the shape of this basic jacket. it perfect to through on to go to yoga or over a dress with heals.
2148	1	a	I was looking for a velvet dress for the holidays. this one was beutiful in color and teksture.the only problem was that it was snug in the shoulders. going a size up would have made it too roomy elswhere.
2149	0	a	This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.
2150	0	a	This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear, though.
2151	1	a	Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.
2152	1	a	"Love this dress! bodice and lace at bottom gives is a cute layered look. there are buttons on the front (see pic), but it does not button up. i'm a bit on the ""hippy"" side....physically hippy, that is...and this dress did a great job of downplaying my hips. ;) i'm 5'4"" and this dress hit just above my knees (a bit longer than on the model in the photo). would look cute with a jean or military jacket! i am wearing a small. 5'4"", 130lbs, 32b chest."
2153	1	a	"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it."
2154	1	a	I do not own any peach outerwear because i did not think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.
2155	0	a	Nice dress, but the leather seats of my car were ruined when the sharp metal beads on the back made deep scratches~ not fun at all. now i must carefully take them out, bad design feature.
2156	1	a	"I was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing. for reference, i am 5' 2"" / 105 lbs / 32a chest, with a thin but athletic build. i love the feel of this shirt. it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape. because i do not have much of a chest, i do think it is a bit low-cut on me. i will probably wear a cami underneath next time. it is a pretty, versatile dress up or down kind of piece, which is why i chose it. i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s"
2157	1	a	I wanted to love this skirt but i got it today and i just was a little disappointed...i read all the reviews but i found it ran small and really fitted not straight pencil like on the model! it is a knit...and it looked like cotton...has a lot of give but it hangs a little weird. the panel in the front does not lie flat and looks a little funky! the colors in the skirt look exactly like the picture on line so that was good... i liked it but did not love it and for $98.00 i want to love it! i am be
2158	0	a	I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today, and while the fit was great, i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it soft and they'd be warm in cold weather, i'm sure. i liked them, but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive, i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work, but sadly, back they go.
2159	1	a	Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.
2160	1	a	"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry"
2161	0	a	I disliked this dress. it did not fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
2162	0	a	I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i do not know if it worth getting another broken one.
2163	0	a	While this is cozy and well made, the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho, which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material, the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately, the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model left hand), viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide), disrupts the effortless, fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
2164	1	a	I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i did not want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in
2165	1	a	These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. ca not wait to buy more in other colors!
2166	1	a	Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!
2167	1	a	They are as comfortable as sweat pants. i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy. i love the fit (skinny can be hard for me - i have athletic thighs) and the length is fantastic. i want more pairs in different washes!!
2168	0	a	I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.
2169	1	a	Super soft shorts. i ordered them in the orange and it a lovely soft orange. they are not too short, about mid thigh. i found the 27 to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size 26. i may order the navy in 26.
2170	1	a	This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual, and probably best used as a beach cover up, as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said, i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing, i usually order a small, and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.
2171	1	a	I saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on. i'm usually xs in retailer tops, but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit. the lace detail is elegant and very pretty.
2172	1	a	Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but do not think petite will work. really, really great shirt.
2173	1	a	This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.
2174	1	a	I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!
2175	1	a	So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who was not expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i
2176	1	a	"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i do not consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)"
2177	1	a	I ordered the green top in store after trying on a medium that was huge. the small fits me well and i love the flowy style and softness of the fabric. i like it with skinny capri jeans and the color will transition well into fall. i'm in florida where it is still very hot in october. if you typically wear either a small or medium, order the small in this top.
2178	1	a	The only complaint i would have about this pullover is that it runs a little big. i ordered a small and it is a little big for my taste but it is not something worth returning it for. i would not say to size down but be aware it is larger than what you would expect. still love it!
2179	1	a	I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which is not apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.
2180	0	a	I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric, but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i do not have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.
2181	1	a	The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it very flattering and slimming.
2182	1	a	Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.
2183	1	a	Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)
2184	1	a	This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.
2185	0	a	I so wanted to love this dress, despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.
2186	1	a	I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles, but do not drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle, but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t
2187	1	a	Love these! i wore them today for the first time and got tons of compliments. they are comfy and sooooo cute for summer. also, fyi, they make my butt look great.
2188	1	a	I originally ordered this top in the black and it been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did! the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso, the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.
2189	1	a	I wanted to love this dress but there were too many factors that ultimately had me sending it back.it is a very unique piece and high quality; however, i have sensitive skin c/o irish genes, and something about the silk/linen/sequin combo had be itching like crazy and really irritated my skin. i also did not love the way the top part of the dress layed on me- it was like there was a bit too much fabric up top meanwhile fitting perfectly around my hips (so i would not want to size down...)
2190	1	a	So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams do not lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it so cute!
2191	1	a	"I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable, and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and have not bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic, which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree, but for those of us who are busty, it an opportunity to wear a cute, breezy style with buttons and a collar!"
2192	1	a	The dress is well-structured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival. because of the length, i would suggest wearing with heels, as it hits below the knee. i would suggest a size down, especially if you are smaller-busted.
2193	1	a	This is the cutest cardigan. i purchased it in the red. i wish there were more colors
2194	1	a	"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/"
2195	1	a	I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!
2196	0	a	I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.
2197	0	a	I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
2198	1	a	I love the color and textures of this jacket.the shawl color adds interest while being cozy and fun. wish it ran a tad longer. otherwise a great mix and match piece.
2199	1	a	I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.
2200	1	a	Wow, wow, wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person, it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well, and it does not fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i do not like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality, very comfortable. fyi, the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person, like an eggplant color. i orde
2201	1	a	"These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10"" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!"
2202	1	a	The reason for the title above is this skirt does not wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere, and i do not go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....__________pros:- tts. i tried on a large (and i'm normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.- flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.- a good everyday skirt.- not sheer at all. it is lined.- when y
2203	1	a	I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however, the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.
2204	1	a	I ordered the xl and the colors are just as pictured. the material is so soft. the problems: too short and too small. i'm a little over 5 ft. 5 inches and this top ran so short on me. i wish there were three more inches of material and then it would have been great. it was cut a little tight along the shoulder line too. i was so disappointed that this could not work on me. i like a romantic style, especially for comfortable basics. but, this was a pass for me. i had to return it. the ruffles on t
2205	1	a	"I think 4-5"" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs, but still feel comfortable running errands, and these fit the bill. they are short, but they are loose, the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice, wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day, wore them 2 days in a row, all day, everywhere, got lots of compliments, comfortable, washed and air dried, ready to go again. i am typically a 12, ordered the large, could probably"
2206	1	a	I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it holding up well!). as you can see from the photos, because of the wrap style, the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and have not had a problem, though if you lift your arms, your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small
2207	1	a	"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey"
2208	1	a	I bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy.
2209	1	a	Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
2210	0	a	First, it huge. i'm not big busted but it so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.
2211	0	a	"I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of ""genie"" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle, but the worst is the fabric. its ""old lady"" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim, and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping."
2212	1	a	This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.
2213	0	a	I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...
2214	1	a	This skirt is adorable. i like it because its different and i like this length. the cactus look gray in the picture, but they are green.
2215	0	a	The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.
2216	1	a	I loved the look of these jeans-super cute-however they were way too tight! i ordered my usual size 31. they do not fit like a darker pair of serif jeans i own. back they go ! i'd be curious if anyone else found these to run smaller.
2217	1	a	"Love this vest- it so chic and pairs with so much. i have it in the army green and it prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top. it great. i am about 5'2"" and an typically a small top- the small was much to big but the xs was perfect. i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain. i am very happy with my purchase!"
2218	1	a	I was drawn to the green/blue color in store! it so cute and comfortable. i'm usually a size 2/4 and needed the 2. the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me. i'm even 4 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so. it got great stretch!
2219	1	a	"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".it soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
2220	1	a	When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store, i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry, or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
2221	0	a	If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
2222	1	a	I just bought this dress in the store and i love it. i'm in my 50s and it does every thing i need a dress to do. it has sleeves, it modest enough and shows my shape. the colors are great and go with most shoes. i'm heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches. great buy!
2223	1	a	I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available, so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i do not think it too white, like some reviewers have stated. you ca not wear a bra with this dress, but t
2224	1	a	"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on.after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!"
2225	1	a	Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.
2226	1	a	"Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it pretty short. i'm just 5'5"", and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b"
2227	0	a	"I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i could not wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue."
2228	1	a	"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy, feels cool but it a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons, but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140, small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt, though it also made to be looser and longer. still, at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m."
2229	1	a	The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style, but it was too tight.
2230	1	a	Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream. the best medium wash, so versatile for all seasons. i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch. sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige. i have a wide waist, slim hips, flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.
2231	0	a	I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute, but missed the mark.
2232	1	a	Super cute and comfortable! soft fabric drapes nicely. i wear this with an orange skirt, white shirts or jeans. i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected! i'm so glad i tried it on! a nice surprise.
2233	0	a	First, the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket, with its crisply cut lapelsand rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including thecool watch pocket), the size of the buttons, the color. i got the honey,and it was lovely and intense,. now, the bad:i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although ita small, tight 8, the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have tobe folded, and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
2234	1	a	This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.
2235	1	a	I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
2236	1	a	Love this product; got them in the coral and they are comfortable, easy, flattering & versatile.dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!
2237	1	a	I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!
2238	1	a	Love this dress! light and breezy, but i'm wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look.
2239	1	a	"I'm curvy, have very muscular thighs and am just under 5'5"". i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans. she was right, they're amazing. they are incredibly flattering, just the right length for me (even tho cropped) as i can wear them as full-length or just add one or two rolls and it a crop. the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite, old pair of jeans. the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie. oh, and"
2240	1	a	I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!
2241	1	a	I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but does not split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep
2242	1	a	Wow.. love this blazer! it not as structured as some blazers , but the woven fabric hugs in the right places. fantastic addition and great alternative to the good'ol black blazer.. great versatility work to play. nice weight for fall, but will also do well for my fl winter. it longer than some of my other blazers, but i like it.. with the front pockets as they are, it makes for a unique design that gets noticed. i got the size 4 and i have broad shoulders for someone @ 135lbs.. makes for a n
2243	1	a	Dress is darling and well made. however, it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
2244	1	a	This shirt runs large in my opinion. i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it. its a great shirt, good quality and i'm very happy i got it.
2245	1	a	I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!
2246	1	a	I bought this to wear to work, but i pictured it as being fancier than it is. the fabric is heavy, stiff sweatshirt material. i bought a small but probably would have been better off with an xs. despite this, it long enough to be a dress on me, and it is comfortable and cute. it will be nice in the winter and could probably be dressed up some.
2247	1	a	I got this dress in the green in an xs and was a little leary of the fit in light of the previous review. however, when i tried it on, i was impressed how it felt in the upper torso - it fit great in the neck, arms and shoulders. and i did not find the rest of the dress to be too roomy, although it was not a snug fit either. it came below the knee on me, but it did not bother me that it was slightly longer than in the modeling pics. it is a little on the itchy side so, it may be best to wear a cami
2248	1	a	I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price), it fits great (i alternate between xs and s, went with s), and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric, secure toggles, etc.), but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside, which is tolerable because of the type of fabric, but come on.
2249	1	a	"Love this sweater! it really flattering, long and lean, though not tight, just the right amount of shape and length for my size. i run between and 8 and a 10, and i'm about 5'8"", i ordered the medium. i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater. i only wish it came in more colors, i'd order it again!"
2250	1	a	The fit and style of this dress are beautiful. it a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable. i really wanted to love it, but the color just did not work for me. the pictures make it look like it a nice cream color, but it very tan and i ca not pull it off with my coloring.
2251	1	a	I honestly liked this little cardigan. it is a misnomer as a jacket. it really is more of a light sweater/cardigan, but i did not have any negative issues like others on here.________pros:- great feel on the skin and fabric. this really caught my attention. hard to find a sweater that breathable for cool summer evenings or mornings.- color scheme will go with anything, elegant touch.- unlined making it breathable.- runs large, forgiving it. stretchy. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l)
2252	0	a	I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine, the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
2253	1	a	"I just got this top in store today. all the colors were ""heathered "", pretty casual colors. the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size. love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details. i hope it does not shrink in the wash and wears well! also, i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others? kind of odd, but i thought worth mentioning:)"
2254	1	a	This dress is very comfortable, very flattering and just lovely. my only critique is that the skirt is more rust colored in real life, where on the website it looks more red. and the bodice looked a bit more peach/pink in the picture. still a beautiful, interesting, well made and extremely comfortable dress. thanks retailer! i am 5'9, 155# and the m is great.
2255	1	a	Absolutely love this dress!! this was my first purchase from this site and as per the usual, i was worried about the sizing but the fit could not be better. definitely wo not be the last. material is heavenly and has a double layering that was a nice surprise. very warm and soft. high quality stuff. i could have gotten my usual size in petite, but i did not want it to be too short. i'm glad i did. this is the perfect dress for work.
2256	1	a	"I got this top in the pink. the colors and pattern are beautiful - i received so many compliments. it is very comfortable - it is ""swingy"" so i paired it with skinny jeans. i usually wear an xs or s - 0 or 2 in retailer tops - i got this in an xs and it fit perfectly."
2257	1	a	Love this dress!! will go from fall to winter. so comfy. got it in medium.. and fits great.
2258	1	a	This dress is fun to wear! i wear the purple one flowy and get lots of compliments. i have not worn the navy yet, but when i do it will be belted. my only complaint is the material that is used at the shoulders shows bra/slip straps. luckily it is not too noticeable but a design flaw worth mentioning nonetheless.
2259	1	a	I ordered this on a whim as i though, hey, i do not have off the shoulder tops let try ti, looks cute...i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately, retailer has been making things baggier, and on a shorter pe
2260	1	a	I ca not say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics do not do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al
2261	1	a	I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;)
2262	1	a	"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#"
2263	1	a	This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
2264	1	a	Love this dress! ordered a 0p and it fit perfectly.
2265	1	a	I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did, thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress.
2266	1	a	I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack, in a moss green color. the material, cut, and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26, and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items, they cost $42 + tax.
2267	1	a	I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i did not like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up, it runs too small.
2268	1	a	I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece
2269	0	a	It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.
2270	1	a	So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress
2271	1	a	I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.
2272	1	a	"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me."
2273	1	a	The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (wo not show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.
2274	1	a	Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!
2275	0	a	Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you could not tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
2276	0	a	When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau
2277	0	a	I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i did not like the material either.
2278	1	a	This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
2279	1	a	Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.
2280	1	a	This is a beautiful knit dress, however it runs large, so be wary. for reference i am a 34d, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips. i ordered a medium because dresses usually run tight around my bum, and it was very, very big. i'm hoping the small is much more flattering because the quality of the knit is very nice.
2281	1	a	I bought this shirt for my 16 year old daughter. it looked adorable on her! she loved it and ca not wait to wear it. the fabric felt like a great quality and the color was quite unique.
2282	1	a	"I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8"", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som"
2283	0	a	This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
2284	1	a	This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.
2285	1	a	I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top. i bought the top and did not notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
2286	1	a	This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!
2287	0	a	This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures, but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy, but unfortunately it did not work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so, perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally, and this was not so much of a con and just something to note, the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the
2288	0	a	These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through, even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.
2289	1	a	"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in"
2290	1	a	This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well, not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i do not mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi
2291	1	a	I was really suprised when i received this top. it was a knit (more like a t-shirt material), which i really like. this way you can wear casual as well as dressing it up. it is not see thru at all and it stay off the shoulder. the one thing i dont like is the elastic band at top is too wide. but overall ita s keeper!
2292	1	a	Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
2293	0	a	I love how these jeans look on. tts, adorable. i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket. pair #2 -the stitching came out in the exact same place. this seems to be a problem with the quality/sewing. the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined. 2nd pair has to go back. too bad.
2294	1	a	Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.
2295	1	a	Gorgeous fabric. love the crochet back of top & cut out sides of bottoms. runs small. i'm 34a - small top fit. 26-36 - medium bottoms fit.
2296	1	a	I originally purchased this sweater in a size small (5'4 125lbs) and i was swimming in it! i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big. i do love the quality though and its so soft! it made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel. it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy! this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home. great product!
2297	1	a	"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i was not crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!"
2298	1	a	Very comfortable, looks good on. like the fabric also.
2299	1	a	I ordered this in a petite online and i usually wear petites. it is not see thru in a way that shows a lot and i love the light weight fabric. i get a lot of compliments on it.
2300	1	a	I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27, which i would say is a pretty true 6.
2301	1	a	"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!"
2302	1	a	True, this blazer runs small, so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue, the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and it got a super-soft lining.
2303	1	a	I love this dress so much - the perfect summer dress. comfortable, easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time!
2304	1	a	In contrast to the other reviewer, i love this dress. worth the sale price at least.
2305	1	a	I ordered these jeans in size 30, and it was a perfect fit. i love the extra stretch in these jeans. will definitely be wearing them all summer long.
2306	0	a	This dress did not work for me for several reasons, but i knew i would not keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.on the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well.
2307	0	a	This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish. unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off. the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
2308	0	a	"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress! i purchased in both a sp and a mp. i am 5'2"" 120#. the mp fit perfectly. i definitely would not keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together. it not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old. the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps. even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn."
2309	1	a	This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself, but i could not say no to that sweet little back detail. i'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric, you've found your answer and then some!
2310	1	a	Very nice casual, inexpensive shirt and the laced neckline is great....not too revealing and easily worn tied without looking prudish. and of course, open as well
2311	1	a	"I am a shorter woman (5'3"") and typically a size large. i purchased this dress in a large. it is flattering and fits well. good length as well."
2312	1	a	I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c
2313	1	a	This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.
2314	0	a	Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper, trouser-like pant--this is not it!
2315	1	a	I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.
2316	1	a	"I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or ""real"" joggers (as in jogging material).cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i did not wwear them, jsut tried them on.grey color was nice."
2317	1	a	So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red, size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.
2318	1	a	I absolutely love this piece. it a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion
2319	1	a	This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.
2320	0	a	This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also, this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
2321	1	a	This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.
2322	1	a	This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so do not wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.
2323	0	a	The material and color of the dress were great, but the fit was rather blah. i do not think it was right for my shape. i am disappointed though, i liked design of it.
2324	1	a	Love the knit. contrast stitches add interest. quality is great and it is true to size. very happy i made this purchase, especially because i caught it on sale after eyeing it for months. great with denim or a black dress.
2325	1	a	This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also do not normally like high waisted ski
2326	1	a	I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance (star wars), this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.
2327	1	a	Beautiful and different material, like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.
2328	1	a	I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.
2329	1	a	I was initially drawn to the shade of blue that these were as i was looking for a lighter late summer denim. after trying them on, i found that i did not want to take them off. they fit well and did not squeeze me anywhere. no muffin top as another reviewer noted. they are definitely a looser fit so size down. i probably could have even sized down again because i found them to stretch out after a while leaving a less flattering fit but certainly still s comfortable wear. absolutely worth a try!!
2330	1	a	It runs a little large, i got a small and it was still a little large in the shoulders (but maybe that is just my body type). otherwise i love this dress!
2331	1	a	Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit.
2332	1	a	Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
2333	1	a	These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!love them
2334	1	a	"This shirt is absolutely beautiful! the front is very thin and delicate, but wearing a nude bra underneath, you ca not see a thing. i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest ""gap"" but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it does not appear to ""pull"" at all. it hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested. this one is it!!!!"
2335	0	a	This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.
2336	0	a	Did not like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
2337	1	a	I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i ca not have everything!
2338	1	a	This dress is soft, comfortable, beautiful and drapes so nicely - not tent-like at all. i was not sure about sizing, and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down, but the small in the strap/underarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium. as another reviewer noted, you cannot adjust the straps, they are stitched together not tied together. i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock. i cannot wait for it to arrive! perfect for summer, or fall with a c
2339	0	a	Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it just not worth 2 because i'm sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it a great looking top. my issue though, was not with the bust as other reviewers hav
2340	1	a	"I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it. it so flattering and well constructed, if a little longer than i usually prefer. i'll just have to wear pumps with it. i do not have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress. it does have pockets, also. i ordered the 12 and it fits beautifully. for reference i have a 40"" bust and 33"" waist."
2341	1	a	This is an awesome tank top, comfortable, great fit, casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top. i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color. this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect.
2342	0	a	Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
2343	1	a	I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!
2344	1	a	"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur"
2345	1	a	Love this skirt! i enjoy being trendy, but i love the retro vibe. can be dressed up, or worn to work.
2346	1	a	"There is so much going on on this dress - it fantastic. hard to tell from pics - but there is a peek-a-boo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model - i'm 5'6"", but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i'm real long waisted - originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa"
2347	1	a	I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just did not feel like it was anything special. if you do not have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i did not like where the arms hit on me. they are not wrist length but they are not mid-fore
2348	1	a	I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it cotton.
2349	1	a	Ok, so maybe i am too picky because the pattern is lovely, the colors are great, the fabric is quality, the fit is flattering, the sizing is appropriate. that said, the high to low hemline shows the inner fabric so it kinda stands out when you are moving and i find it distracting so unfortunately i am returning it. sizing reference, i wear a size 8/10 in pants, i'm 5'3 and the medium petite fit comfortably.
2350	1	a	I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i do not think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.
2351	0	a	"This top is cute, but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs, but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2"", 110 lbs, 34a). even worse, though, was the feel of this shirt. it not lined, so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy, and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it a pretty shirt, but not worth actually wearing."
2352	0	a	"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she small on top. ther"
2353	1	a	I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb, heavy and glossy, good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i could not try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete
2354	1	a	This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.
2355	1	a	This is a very soft and feminine chemise. it is a little more see thru than i had anticipated, but i still love it!
2356	1	a	This dress ladies is simply amazing and perfect!!!
2357	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it self is beautiful, good quality, and a perfect summer maxi. however, it was way too big. i'm 5'6, 118 lbs, i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress, so i choose to get it tailored.
2358	1	a	"I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail. it very lightweight, perfect for spring, cool summer night, early fall. i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in. there is enough fabric in the front to give it a ""flowy"" look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage! great top!"
2359	0	a	I wanted to love this dress, and i do not. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i wo not pull it from my closet to wear again, very often.
2360	1	a	Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up, mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8 were not big at all, so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband, but i do not think that can be prevented.
2361	1	a	"This was adorable, but looks much better on the lean, flat chested model. i am only 110 lbs and 5'4"" but i am curvy and it just did not do me any justice so i will be returning. i think this would look better on someone more flat chested, because it really accentuates the bust."
2362	0	a	I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves, however, ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts, no fitted places, nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned, it sprea
2363	1	a	This is a cute sweater that can be very versatile. i love to wear it to work with a dress pant as well as with jeans on the weekends. it is soft and looks great on. would recommend.
2364	1	a	I've been wanting a higher-waisted, button-front skirt. this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim.. it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a business-casual setting. i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons. i'm normally a 0 or 2 in dresses (5'6, 118 lbs) and i ordered a 0 in the skirt, as the natural waist is a little on the large side. i love it!
2365	1	a	I bought this sweater/coat as a gift for my mother. she absolutely loves.it. it does seem to run a little large, and the sleeves are especially long. the navy and grey color combo is very nice. it seems like it will be very warm too.
2366	1	a	I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath ca not solve. a good buy!
2367	1	a	Like everyone else, i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it was not until i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so have not been able to wear it much, but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it classy and can dress up any outfit.
2368	1	a	Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
2369	1	a	Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.
2370	0	a	I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this is not tmi.. of note: the dark bl
2371	1	a	This was way better than i expected it to be. tts and flattering. the material on the top section is on the thinner side, but is very soft and comfortable. the skirt section is a little on the shorter side for me, but with tights i think i could still make it wearable for work.
2372	1	a	I just bought this jacket for my mom to take with her on a trip to europe. it is perfect! perfect packing piece that doesnt wrinkle and is a substantial enough weight to wear on chilly evenings. considering buying an additional one in my size...
2373	1	a	I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it. they were talking about how cute it was (they did not have it in the store). i asked what size it was and it was a medium, so i said i want to try it on. after trying it on, i fell in love, it is so cute, the cut fit great. it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust. if you are in between sizes, you can probably size down. i wore it yest
2374	1	a	"I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i ca not wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6"""
2375	1	a	Great quality, i did not expect the neck to be so wide but it still looks nice.
2376	1	a	Adorable skirt. the eyelet part on the bottom is cut-out so see through but cute and subtle. found it fit a little snug on me- could just be my build, but i ordered it in normal size and 1 size up. the size up fit best.
2377	0	a	I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
2378	1	a	The print on this dress is gorgeous---but the material does not stretch whatsoever, and there are not zippers or buttons to ease in the fit. i always, always, always wear a size zero. it was a massive struggle to even get the dress over my head and on to my body. i felt like i was getting crushed! once on, although awfully small, the dress is just beautiful in every way. so chic! i just returned it and ordered two sizes up---here hoping it fits!
2379	0	a	"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it very light-weight fabric but is not see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs, so there simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it avai"
2380	1	a	Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i did not give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it was not distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!
2381	1	a	"I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went, but when i ordered mine, there were mostly all good reviews. i absolutely love these lounge pants. someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever, they are certainly very comfortable, not itchy at all. i am 5'6"""" 140 lbs and i ordered the medium. the fit was a little snug at first but, as i wore them, they stretched and loosened. i also wear them with"
2382	1	a	This cardigan is super soft and comfy with nice big pockets and an easy feel. i am glad i read the other reviews before i bought it, though. i usually wear an xl (and they are often too small), but i ordered a large and even that one is a bit on the generous size. but i really like it a lot!
2383	1	a	"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they do not loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to."
2384	1	a	This sweater is really pretty (and soft!) in real life, but if you purchase the coral color, be ready for a little bit of a surprise when you open the package. while it looks more orange and subdued online, it more like a hot pink coral in real life. definitely more pink than orange and far more vibrant than pictured. still pretty, but not necessarily my taste so still deciding if it will go back or not. the cut and fit of the sweater is wonderful, though. it so soft and airy, but definitely
2385	1	a	"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it simple, but a really flattering cut that i do not think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa"
2386	0	a	I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also, i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
2387	0	a	I ordered this on-line, in a size 8. the fit is ample and fine fine, and the fabric is acceptable, but as much as i wanted to like it, and keep it, i ultimately returned it. it is just too, too conservative for me. i loved the deep olive/khaki colour, and even experimented wearing it open as a duster over a top and slip pants, leggings, or skinny jeans, but the collar and the front pocket styling are just too man-tailored and cargo-like in their styling for me. i tried it with different belts, w
2388	1	a	All i really need to say is this is the perfect layering piece. i love that you have a choice in the neckline that you want to wear. form flattering and is true to size.
2389	1	a	I loved this top even more in person! it is made well and beatiful! the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design. the back of the shirt is open. i really like this detail!
2390	1	a	Would not have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!
2391	1	a	These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..
2392	1	a	I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight, soft, good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.
2393	1	a	It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart, debated, and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing, because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer, went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock
2394	1	a	Soft and stretchy denim. beautiful color. i do wish they had a tiny bit higher rise but they fit like my other paige skinnies.
2395	1	a	I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs, i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t
2396	1	a	"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well"
2397	1	a	This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!
2398	1	a	I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite. it has a very clean design, well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch. i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come.
2399	1	a	This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft! looks great with booties and flats! can be paired with so much! jackets, scarfs, long necklaces! so glad i bought it! i did down size to a small from my usual medium! and got the regular instead of petite! fit great
2400	1	a	I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.
2401	0	a	I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
2402	1	a	Great top - i have both colors. because the front is hort' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small.
2403	1	a	This t is so pretty in person. the gold is metallic with embroidered detail. this is my first purchase of this brand, so my usual size medium fit just fine. i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday. it is quite unusual and great quality.
2404	1	a	Cute tank, runs big. i purchased the mango and it a bit sheer.
2405	1	a	I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12, so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides, it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them), then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it does not really have sleeves - it more like hol

2407	0	a	"I bought the orange color. i had a hard time styling it as it is so long. since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve, you'll need a jacket or sweater on top. nothing looked right. it has a relatively high and tight neck, so sweaters looked weird. short jackets did not work either. i'm 5'4"" and bought the small. returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
2408	1	a	Oh just wow. this jacket is simply wonderful. ordered my regular size large and it a bit oversized due to the swing cut and absolutely adorable on. love everything about it except the length which is very cropped. it lightweight yet warm and very cuddly. the snap closure is wonderful. then there the leather trim which just takes it up a notch. plenty of room for a sweater and it lined. although it so cropped, i think the length will be attractive worn over anything that longer.
2409	1	a	"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu"
2410	1	a	I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go
2411	1	a	This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.
2412	1	a	Lovely crochet lace tunic. also very comfortable. does not wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel.
2413	1	a	I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just did not know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
2414	1	a	Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small.
2415	1	a	Just received this dress today. i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico. i wanted a nice coverup.this is beautiful. fits nicely without looking like a tent.i would highly recommend. this is one size fits all.
2416	0	a	The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute. now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it not... it see through and unlined... it scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine, the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail. i wanted to like this, but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c
2417	1	a	"I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i do not wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu. it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look, showing some ankle and wearing dress flats . would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee. since i'm only 5'3"" and this is travel-wear, i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffed-look but cover my ankles. i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t"
2418	1	a	I tried on the pink in xs in store. it was so big on me. i wanted to love it, the stylist did, but i felt meh... so did another costumer, didn&#39;t like it on me. the colors are really nice (and the blue seems really nice too), but the cut was a little wide. fabric is very soft. for reference, i am 115 lbs, 0dd, 26.5 in waist.
2419	1	a	This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned. the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice. for reference, i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering.
2420	1	a	Bought this dress for a wedding in petite. fits true to size. beading & embroidery is beautiful in person. only downside is that the beads & embroidery are very delicate and damage even when sitting on a chair.
2421	1	a	Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.
2422	1	a	I saw this blouse and had to have it. i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was. it looked like a maternity top on me, so i sized down to medium. it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was. i definitely recommend it, but suggest to size down for a better fit.
2423	0	a	I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.
2424	1	a	Ordered these in a size 32 and they fit perfectly!
2425	1	a	I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress, too cute!
2426	1	a	I tried on the 00p in the store as a return, adn though it would fit (super stretchy)hte dress ended up mid thigh for me... gorgeous design and make though, the buttoning is incredible, buttons and clasps to keep the dress closed. love love, wish htey still had my size (0p or 2p ) to try if hte length would be better (or regular size)
2427	1	a	"So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10"" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain does not work. i think if you are taller this dress just wo not work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem."
2428	1	a	I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
2429	1	a	I have now purchased these pants (online) three times in the ivory. i first ordered them in a 28 as it was the only size available, and i thought that size would fit me in this brand. wrong! i was swimming in them. great pants, but too large in the waist. i kept checking online and they popped back in a 27, which i thought would fit. wrong again! they arrived a couple of days ago, and still they are too large in the waist, but since 27 was the only size available, i thought that i would keep the
2430	1	a	This has been my go to top for cooler days, so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10, 36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size, but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.
2431	1	a	I decided to order this on a whim during the promotion on tops, why? because it looked decent and i like the other tops from the same brand. i am so glad i did, it is even better in person.color: nice ivory with subtle speckle in it. very neutral in color, but also on the warmer side. the fabric is a little sheer, you could definitely see my bright colored bra, but a nude one will do the trick.the length was a little longer, and the sleeves were a bit long too (does not come in peite0, bu
2432	1	a	I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening, some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but did not have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight, which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se
2433	0	a	I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green was not quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back...
2434	0	a	"I'm tall (5'11"" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it."
2435	1	a	I'm a 36ddd and although that pretty large, i do not generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress, for example, fits just fine in my regular size.) so, i ordered this dress in my regular size. well, i tried it on, and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit, even if i went up 3 sizes. it crazy!this is a terrible shame because it really a lovely dress and it fits j
2436	1	a	Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!
2437	0	a	I ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me. it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders, however, i'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me. the quality is nice. it is medium in weight. it has a cottony feeling, but it not super soft. it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me. i wanted to love it, but i only just like it. i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun, loose look in a sweater.
2438	1	a	Soft, slouchy, and comfortable.what more could you ask for?
2439	0	a	"Like another reviewer said this was too baggy up top. the bottom length was good but arm holes were big and top was just too large. i'm 5'5"" 110 lbs and got xs. returned."
2440	1	a	I bought this jacket in the gray and could not be happier with it. it is loose fitting but not oversized. it will look great over a dress with boots, or with jeans. very versatile piece.
2441	1	a	This shirt is comfy, fits well, the color (pink or dusty rose) works well with most outfits, but the front hook is ill-placed and often visible. it could be tucked under better so as not to show, but it is not and does show. i feel that i frequently need to fluff it up to hide the hook. otherwise, i like it, but i would not have bought it unless it was on discount, which it was.
2442	1	a	Dress really pretty and great quality. slip is small if large breasted.
2443	1	a	This sweater is perfect for cool days. the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite). i actually liked the length so did not order petite. the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend. it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse. the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it does not open in front, which is a plus. the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue. the red is beautiful and as pictured.
2444	0	a	I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print is not as r
2445	1	a	"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look."
2446	1	a	I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you do not mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.
2447	1	a	This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out
2448	1	a	"I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9"" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it a no-brainier purchase."
2449	1	a	I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no
2450	0	a	This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.
2451	1	a	"I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i'm 5""3 and the dress is not too long like most maxi are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now!"
2452	1	a	"This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs and a size 4 fit perfectly."
2453	1	a	I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. do not expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!
2454	0	a	I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite, it is lovely. i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up. it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear. looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...
2455	1	a	Unlike other reviewers, i found these pants to run true to size (in my case, my usual 6) or even a tad roomy. the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties. i appreciate the belt loops!
2456	0	a	I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however, the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it does not lay flat around the top, and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price, i do not think it is worth it. i do not like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
2457	1	a	"These jeans are perfect--exactly what i was looking for. i was afraid the rise might be too high but it was just right, well below the belly button. i abhor anything resembling a ""mom jean"" rise. they will look really chic with boots as well as sandals or flats. i have lots of pants in my wardrobe but i have a feeling this will be a favorite pair."
2458	1	a	With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:_________pros:- lots of stretch and comfort.- pockets! always a plus in my book :)- will go with any top.- nice length. fit me as in the model.- very slimming.- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi
2459	1	a	The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str
2460	1	a	Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down, which is hard to find too. perfect length, beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos do not show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look
2461	0	a	I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i could not justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just could not get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
2462	1	a	This is exactly what i was looking for! a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt. falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable.
2463	1	a	I ca not believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.
2464	1	a	Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i ca not say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.
2465	1	a	I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me, and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts, but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace, however. it is so delicate. no issues, but just be careful!
2466	1	a	The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!
2467	1	a	My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant.
2468	1	a	These culottes run very large--more than 2 inches of gaping waist band in my usual size. i would have kept them if they had fit, although sitting in them on a hot day might cause major wrinkling
2469	1	a	"I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy. i love the layered look and the contrasting colors. i am 100 lbs, 5'3"" and got the regular xs. i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately. the regular was a little too big but it still works! looks great with jeans or dress pants....even a skirt! very versatile and classy and creative styling."
2470	1	a	Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%, which you do not see often anymore!), great length, nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch, but as someone with a small waist and wider hips, i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that just not possible with these. if you do not usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure, these might work better
2471	1	a	I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that.
2472	1	a	I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i did not realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. i love this so much!
2473	0	a	First, i love moth clothing and own many, many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute, buttons run all the way down...caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i was not doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
2474	1	a	"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser, relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories."
2475	1	a	I received this today and totally bummed it not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you'd have up in your closet for years. good quality, feels nice, and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they'd put a little detail on the back, maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i'm very pleased.
2476	1	a	"I love this coat! i purchased the size 6. i am a size 6 petite, but they were out. plus i wanted the coat to be a little longer. i was not a fan of how high it was on the model. it fit as i expected. i will have to take up the arm length, and it hit a little longer than it did on the model. i am 5' 120 pounds. 34cthe quality is what i expected. it excellent with lining. color is as shown. this coat will go with everything! i plan to dress it up and down. i purchased the ""orange"" pants and the"
2477	1	a	Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i do not have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.
2478	1	a	I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear
2479	0	a	Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
2480	1	a	Adorable skirt! thought it would be snug so ordered up, but had to send back and re-order in normal size. fits perfect. found it to be slimming on the backside, yay! :) this will be a wardrobe staple for many years to come!
2481	1	a	Loved this top on model. even happier when it went on sale. sort of boxy. but still excited, then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric! disappointed. my other tees i purchased are fine.
2482	1	a	It really is a beautiful sweater. the material is super soft and feels luxurious. unfortunately, it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width. maybe if i were taller, i could pull it off.
2483	1	a	"This is one of my favorite tops! it is comfortable and an easy ""throw and go"" top. i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare. very pleased :)"
2484	1	a	I bought the blue/green color. it was absolutely beautiful...i paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up. very comfortable, versatile, flexible and the color is rich. i am 5'5 and 147 pds and the m fit perfect.
2485	1	a	Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel, yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine, sexy, comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small, wish i would've went for a petite x-small, however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3, 110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.
2486	1	a	"Too bad the blue one is sold out in my size (petite), i ordered the 00p, based on feedback at m store that it runs big, that was a good choice (i am 5'1.5"", 115 lbs#. the material teds to wrinkle though, so will have to think about keeping it.cut is flattering, i like it with the belt like the picture on the model, but was nice too with the drawstring and a nice chunky necklace #bought black dress, so gold necklace is nice).length was mid calf, but because it has a rounded hem, it wa"
2487	1	a	I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i could not believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine was not available but because of lace and side zip, it still does not look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange, but i could not leave the dress behind.
2488	1	a	"I'm 5'3"" with high waist and some booty. this dress has a fantastic, flattering fit. i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model. (love the belt too, btw). the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath. i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals. looking for a suede jacket now..."
2489	1	a	Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.
2490	0	a	I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i did not like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
2491	0	a	I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft
2492	1	a	First pair of mother jeans, went with my regular 25 (as in my citizens/paige/ag) and it fits well. the waist doenst seem as high as it looks in the model (i wish it was). the fabric is stretchy and soft. it looks the same finish/color as online, a greyish denim. i like it.
2493	1	a	I've been searching for a velvet top or dress for awhile. this arrived yesterday and it absolutely beautiful. the color is rich and the fabric is thick and feels and looks like a very expensive, high quality item. i got it with the 25% off promo but it worth every penny of the full price. ca not wait to wear for the holidays! get this dress!
2494	1	a	Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work, with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape, with the large wing like sleeves, makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold, you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though, i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and wo not be do not a ton of moving aro
2495	1	a	I cannot wait for summer! when i received this item i felt the same as the other reviewers. it may be a little pricey for the material. then i tried it on. i love it. just add some accessories and let go!
2496	1	a	This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which is not large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!
2497	1	a	The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2), but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable, breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!
2498	1	a	These pants are beautiful. the color is a nice deep red. pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself. my only regret is listening to the other reviewer. these pants run true to size. i am normally a 0p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a 00 because of the review claiming they run small. the waist is accurate sizing. the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th
2499	1	a	This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it a little boxy without making me look huge. it excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!
2500	1	a	Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches, 38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top, and that works perfectly with the design.
2501	1	a	"This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs, which i nesrly always wear, but i measure 35"" in the bust and it fits well, but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value."
2502	1	a	These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.
2503	1	a	This is the most fabulous sweater ever. i really hesitated spending $368 for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime! it is soft and luxurious. i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable -- i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good. if it came in another color - i'd buy it too.
2504	0	a	Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.
2505	1	a	Love the style, fabric and fit generally, but even ordering down a size, i could yank them right down. trying going down one more size, but not sure it will work as much as i want it to.
2506	1	a	This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,
2507	1	a	Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt
2508	1	a	I love this dress. i did not think that i would feel at ease as it is very form-fitting. but it is so comfortable! and warm. it is dressy yet casual. i have received many compliments.
2509	0	a	This dress is cuter is person than online, but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i ca not believe these other reviewers did not have the same problem. or, maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.
2510	0	a	Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
2511	1	a	I really like this shirt overall. i'm 5'2 and the petite sizes were sold out so i bought a regular. if you are short like me, beware that the sleeves am be almost comically long. while the shirt is stretchy, the cuffs are not so pushing the sleeves up is not really an option. also, it had lots of loose, hanging threads straight out of the package. but overall, it a keeper!
2512	1	a	"Whoa! these are very high-waisted. but i think i like it! this is a very 70s style with the high waist and wide legs. the brown motif is kinda funky! i am a 70s/vintage lover though, so i was pleasantly surprised. the tall length is more than adequately long for my 6'2"" frame. i may need to take them up a little bit, in fact."
2513	1	a	It just as cute in person as it was in the picture. the material is very, very soft and weater like'. i ordered my usual size and it fit fine, but i usually wear my dresses a bit looser. i liked it well enough to return it for a larger size.
2514	0	a	I ordered the pink, and it was gorgeous. the color and feel were so soft, i would have kept it if it were a blanket. but i did send it back because as a sweater, it just did not lay right. it has a sort of inside layer that just did not fit right with the outside sweater layer, so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist. that was not flattering. and the hood was too large and floppy looking. too bad.
2515	1	a	This is the best ever t-shirt i've ever worn. feels so soft! looks gorgeous! very comfortable and yet has that bit of sparkle that makes it perfect for a special evening with friends etc! just love the fit- it makes me look slimmer:)
2516	1	a	"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
2517	0	a	I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i was not expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
2518	1	a	"I am 5'8"", broad shoulders,can sometimes wear a size 4 depending on the cut. i purchased the size 6 and was a true fit. just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are. the fabric us light and great quality. perfect for a summer night out. so happy with this purchase"
2519	0	a	I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
2520	0	a	I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
2521	1	a	This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :)
2522	1	a	I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate, boho, colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room, but it is not quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves, so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
2523	0	a	Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and did not hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..
2524	1	a	I just received this swimsuit today and love it! i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts, but i feel it is very flattering.i was choosing between an xs and s. i ended up going with xs and am glad i did, i think going up would of caused gaping on the sides.great suit, only comment is in the description i believe it said the straps are adjustable, but they are not. also, there is light padding which i appreciate.
2525	1	a	"I love this blazer! it so comfortable! i just wonder if the company makes more ""inserts"" in different fabrics/colors? i'd love to be able to change it up a bit."
2526	1	a	Great boho chic top. a bit over - sized but soft and love the colors!
2527	0	a	This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it did not move well with me
2528	1	a	I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time. i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for.
2529	1	a	"Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color , but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall, but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and"
2530	1	a	"Luckily i found this in the store though it is on backorder online, so if you really want it - go to/call the store. it effortless, fun, beautiful, and nicely detailed. love this top. i'm 5'5"" and usually wear size 6, and i bought a small. really worth the price b/c you can just throw it on and look fabulous. layers well. so happy i got this."
2531	1	a	Lovely foxy sweater. i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too!
2532	1	a	Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
2533	1	a	This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!
2534	1	a	I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost did not get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.
2535	1	a	Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
2536	1	a	I purchased this on sale, xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it an adorable sweater, but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy, but i would say itchy and cozy!
2537	1	a	Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it versatile to wear everywhere
2538	1	a	I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i could not resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and does not require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it made of high quality fabric, there a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i ca not imagine why other
2539	1	a	It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly. i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory, it has some pinkish tones to it, it is absolutely beautiful. looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans.
2540	1	a	The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.
2541	1	a	Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.
2542	1	a	"This dress is amazing. based upon its rack appearance i never would have tried this dress on but the fabric was irresistibly soft so i gave it a try. i was amazed to see it fit so well. i'm very curvy (125lbs, 5'4"", 32dd ) so normally a dress without structure does not work on me but this one somehow does. the elastic waist hits right at the smallest part of my waist (i'm very short waisted if that helps) and flows from there beautifully. i think the v-cut at the chest area help reduce the appear"
2543	1	a	I have a tough time shopping for jeans because almost everything that fits my butt is too big in the waist. also, i have thick thighs so that an issue and i hate shopping for jeans. these are so much cuter on than on the hanger. try them. you wo not regret it. so flattering.
2544	0	a	I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.
2545	1	a	This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!
2546	1	a	Love these chinos! they are so soft, have the right amount of stretch for a curvy figure, and the colors are great. i have purchased the khaki and blue so far. the blue color has the perfect washed/faded look. i love that they have petite sizes available. i will be stocking up on the other colors.
2547	0	a	So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me.
2548	1	a	Gorgeous material, great length for tall girls, warm without being too heavy, super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year, not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that does not wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great
2549	1	a	I had to order this dress three times to get the correct size. ordered a petite which worked great. i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best. love the color! perfect for so many occasions, church, special events and dinner out. great with flats and wedges. i know i will be wearing it lots this summer. did i mention i love the color! worth repeating.
2550	0	a	I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you ca not see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.
2551	1	a	"These pants are nothing short of amazing! they have a great wide leg with plenty of beautiful flow to them. i am 6 months pregnant and can wear them under my bump, but they are by no means maternity pants (i have only gained 8 lbs). they have a nice silky material that will be great for hot summer weather and will be great, comfortable travel pants. the only downfall is the length. i am 5'6"" with long legs and will have to get 2-3 inches chopped off."
2552	0	a	I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup, beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs, but it does not. unfortunately, this one is
2553	1	a	This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
2554	1	a	Perfect summer/fall top. can also layer it. i wear it over a tank tunic and love it.
2555	1	a	Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.
2556	1	a	This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.
2557	0	a	"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going, but it was not, it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference, i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me, not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season."
2558	1	a	"Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small. i actually found it to run exactly true to size. i'm 5'6"" 38-26-38 slender, and on average i wear a size 6, which is what i ordered - 6 regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me. this dress is made very well - looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model. i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price."
2559	1	a	Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!
2560	1	a	"This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a ""dressy"" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and"
2561	1	a	The colors were not what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just could not find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just was not for me, in the end.
2562	0	a	Having read all the reviews, i still (bravely) ordered in a size 2 (i can be a 0 or 2 in this brand)...first reaction? adorable style. second reaction? who was the model for this? i am pear shaped, and not short waisted, but the waist is low, and the top is snug...afraid a 4 would be too much top, but do not relish constantly pulling the dress down to keep the waist where it should be. am going into my local mall store, to see if they do have a 4...perhaps that will be better. really hesitant to
2563	1	a	Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt.
2564	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress! the color is really great and i love the cut - flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy. the one downside is that it is pretty long. i am 5'6"" and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses, so went with the xs. the size is great but it just a tad long for wearing with flats. i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine, but since i'm pretty flat there nothing to fill the dress! i wish i had been able to snag a petite, but they w"
2565	1	a	"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i ca not wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!"
2566	1	a	This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.
2567	1	a	This is classic retailer at it best. quality style a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come. first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/4 length coat. versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay
2568	1	a	Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!
2569	1	a	Originally got one with a stain. retailer quickly sent a replacement,useful with many skirts and pants. well made.
2570	1	a	I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).
2571	1	a	I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat, and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it feminine and delicate in appearance, yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it awesome, just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.
2572	1	a	Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!
2573	0	a	I tried this sweater on in the store. i love the design and was hoping it would look as good on me as it does on the model. first off i should point out that the navy color in the featured photo looks much lighter than the sweater does in person. some of the photos accurately represent how dark the blue is (it almost looks black) but the featured photo shows it more like a medium navy. secondly, anyone looking to purchase should know it is very warm. if you are buying to wear mostly indoors you
2574	0	a	I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it a return.
2575	1	a	I have an upside-down triangle shape. i am a 4/6 on the bottom and a 10/12 on top. i have a short waist. i have very slim hips and virtually no waist. so, a typical jumpsuit or romper really does not fit me. this one is the exception! likely because it ties in the back, but the s fit me perfectly. the bottom half is easy, but not oversized. the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable, so there is no issue with size. i am 36c on top, but i think that i could pull off the top, without a bra. you can
2576	1	a	I love this t-shirt, i feel classy, stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted, it is bellowy in the peplum, but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!
2577	1	a	I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!
2578	1	a	I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.
2579	1	a	I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it was not an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it a fantastic purchase!
2580	1	a	I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it cut across the shoulders that do not allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)
2581	1	a	The perfect summer top. paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments!
2582	1	a	I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer. it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.
2583	1	a	These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
2584	1	a	I got the tan one. my friend got the same skirt. she tiny, i'm not (i have hips). we both got a size 6, and it fit us both. it just sits higher on my waist than it does on hers (above my navel - not above hers). i do have a small waist. the skirt has a lot of movement, but is not poofy. it is not see-through. it has that retailer charm, where it looks pretty basic but is really flattering and charming. a new wardrobe staple. can dress it up or down. only problem is the zipper in the back -
2585	1	a	This is such a darling velvet dress. understated, yet eye catching, i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder, but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and ca not wait to wear it!
2586	1	a	It is one of the best dress for the season. light, nice color, elegant, can not find more word of it. really great buy! this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently. just want to give a+ to the designer.
2587	0	a	I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit does not have a waist, i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it the longest zipper i've ever seen. it very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
2588	1	a	Beautiful color, great quality! on sale too. a must have!
2589	1	a	This top is just lovely. the bow on the back is so unusual. i am so glad i bought it!!! i washed it on gentle and it turned out great!!!
2590	1	a	"I love the pattern and flowy design. i also like the peach liner but i will use that on other outfits i own and replace it with a slip that has a designed hem. this top is too long for me to wear as a top. so i will wear as a dress with the a longer slip. i'm hoping that the sequins will remain intact for the most part as the construction of everything is too delicate. bought the size s and i am 6'3"" 140# 39-28-35."
2591	1	a	I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i did not have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.
2592	1	a	"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body does not look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual."
2593	1	a	I saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style. i really did not think it'd fit on me, even though the only size available was a size 12, because it looked like a sheath-type dress that more body hugging, and usually such dresses just do not work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame. howeverl here what i thought:_____________pros:- beautiful blush pink. it looks exactly the same in person as online.- very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned. t
2594	1	a	Casual, pretty. runs a little large, especially through the waist, but a great comfortable shirt.
2595	1	a	Love love love these!! the model does not do them justice since she makes them look like high rise pants. they are very soft with 15% stretch which is why i sized down . i usually wear a 30. you can remove the roll and they fit perfect w a heel . for those curvy women they look great! also have a slouchy appeal too but tailored . i went everywhere looking for chinos and these are the best ones out there!! for reference i am 141 pounds and 5'4 just losing weight from having a baby and absolutely
2596	1	a	I bought this during the 20% off and i'm glad i did. the sweater does run large, so i would recommend sizing down. i'm 5'4, 135 lbs, with a larger bust (34d) and even the size small is large on me (not large enough to exchange, but i would probably do better with an xs; even with an xs i would still get that oversized look). the color is not exactly as pictured, it is a brighter yellow in person. i was expecting more of a muted, soft, baby yellow, and that not exactly what this is. some pros a
2597	1	a	This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also, the colors in t
2598	1	a	This piece is a great, easy throw on that allows you to still look polished. it heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those in-between fall weather days when you do not want to lug a jacket around. lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear.
2599	1	a	What a great purchase! love this vest. i live in pa and i see myself wearing this sweater for 3 seasons, which i love. great details, length, and knit. true to size
2600	1	a	I just bought this dress in the store and i absolutely love it except for one thing. why are the sleeves on the actual dress so much shorter than the picture with the model? i suspect the model has long arms, not little t-rex arms, so why does the sleeve hit at the top of her wrist, while my lovely dress hits just past my elbow. it a mystery. was the pictured item not what the store took delivery of? anyway, still a great dress, just trying to figure out if i should add lace or something to ma
2601	0	a	I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just was not flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.
2602	1	a	"This dress has been on retailer site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i ca not believe i waited so long! it so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!"
2603	1	a	I love cloth & stone clothes and have this version in a long sleeved shirt. it is a little boxy, but the weight of the fabric helps with hang of it. i love the feel of the fabric and the weight of it for a summer dress, yet it is too sheer for a summer dress. it needs a liner or little cami dress to wear under it to keep it from being see through, however, for a texas summer, that defeats the point of a loose, easy dress to throw on. i sadly sent mine back.
2604	0	a	Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small, (120, 5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. di not have to ponder about it at all.
2605	1	a	I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i was not sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
2606	1	a	I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny, high waisted version. first, i do not like the faux whiskering on the jeans, i think it makes them look cheap. second, the fabric had more stretch than i'm use to for pilcro denim, and made them feel low quality. i do not think they are terrible, i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of
2607	1	a	Got the green one
2608	1	a	"This dress is fantastic! it super flattering and very versatile. for reference, i am 5'4"" and 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 - 10 in retailer dresses. the size medium fit perfectly. highly recommend this item!"
2609	1	a	This dress is beautiful. it is not meant to be super form fitting so in my opinion it was true to size altho i could see how others may want it to be more so in which case, size down. it came wrinkled but they make it in petite so they are forgiven and the material is such that i'm not sure how it could be prevented.
2610	1	a	"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i wo not have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it gorgeous!!"
2611	1	a	I love this style and was pleasantly surprised that it fit my curvy shape well, despite it being a fairly straight shift style. it does wrinkel easily because of the linen fabric, but otherwise is really perfect! it is dressy enough for bridal showers or brunches but could also be worn casually.
2612	1	a	When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.
2613	0	a	Cute fit but... split in the thigh after two weeks. and i'm not a big gal. poor quality.
2614	1	a	This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back does not wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!
2615	1	a	I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it a true orange so i returned this one. i did not really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect
2616	1	a	Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.
2617	1	a	I love this coat, and wanted it to fit so badly! a 12-14 always fits well, but i ca not even start to button up the large in this coat. so sad!!!
2618	1	a	This blouse is an all season winner.i bought the taupe and can wear it with or without a cami, under a sweater. alone, with skirts, pants, jeans. i am 5'7, 135# and a medium was perfect although i normally wear a small.
2619	1	a	I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.
2620	1	a	This coat is very nice. it soft and the colors are great. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars and not 5 is that it runs huge! i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium. when i put it on i just started laughing. it was so huge. i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size. i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did
2621	1	a	These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did, so i'm stoked.
2622	1	a	"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home, it was so tight i could not zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust, order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top."
2623	0	a	I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.still looking for the perfect dress...
2624	1	a	I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.
2625	1	a	This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.
2626	1	a	This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.
2627	1	a	"When i tell people i invested in a ""horse sweater"" i do not get a lot of encouraging comments, but when they see it they understand. so cute, different, and cozy for cold days (winter is long where i live). really works as both a sweater and as a coat."
2628	1	a	Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.
2629	1	a	Love the high rise and stretch of this jean- i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl! i feel these run a little small for pilcro- i went up a size.
2630	1	a	I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.
2631	1	a	"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely."
2632	1	a	At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.
2633	1	a	I bought this blouse on sale in a medium because it was the last one left in the store. i usually wear a large, but surprisingly it fit. i'm a woman of color, and the off white and lace looks great with my complexion. i got many compliments on the blouse as i made my way to the register to check out. i ca not wait to wear it this spring. i'll have to be careful when wearing this blouse because one good snag with a fingernail, or necklace and the lace will be torn. other than that, i'm very happy
2634	1	a	"I had this in my cart for ages, waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general. i am delighted as it did finally go on sale, i bought it, and it is fabulous!!! my measurements are 36/28/39, i wear a 34d bra, and the small fit perfectly. the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about 3/8"" at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress. what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling, but the lining does not, hence the showing. i"
2635	1	a	Awesome fabric, wonderfully flattering cut. love the blue and green colors.
2636	1	a	"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su"
2637	1	a	I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just did not think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.
2638	1	a	"This dress has a unique watercolor-like pattern and design and is silk, but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip. the side slits come up high, almost to the hip. i am 5'1"" and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i do not wear a belt. if i belt it, the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress. i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo"
2639	1	a	I am a 4, so i ordered the s. slipped these pants on and i could not get them zipped up. i thought perhaps i ordered a 0, nope, a s. i'm not even sure a m would fit! these unfortunately are going back tomorrow. the material and color were beautiful (bronze), but the sizing is very strange!
2640	1	a	This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i did not want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up would not have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
2641	1	a	I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything. as another reviewer noted, some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart. not something acceptable at this price point.unlike her, this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily, for weeks and feel like the buttons, trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft, warm and cl
2642	1	a	Absolutely adore this dress. soft and comfortable fabric, ankle length but could be knotted in the front to be shorten. i am usually a s but had to buy an xs. the neckline may be a bit too low, if you are flat-chested. if you happen to see this gem in stores... it is a must buy! it will sell out completely in two days. some customer went back to exchange the next day that it had arrived in-stores but it was sold out, so we had to order it. perfect for all seasons and layering.
2643	1	a	This is a very well made sweater. it is a nice weight, great for cool mornings and evenings. i do not think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans. i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops.
2644	1	a	I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe
2645	1	a	The cotton silk blend fabric is beautiful and breathes well. i would not have given this dress a thought based on the online pics, but in person i found it femine, pretty and comfortable for an outdoor garden party i'm attending. it is not too short when i sit or bend over and with some funky, colorful jewelry i really liked it. i enjoy the slightly puffy, gathered shoulder. i did size down so the dress would not be too blowzy but mostly b/c i wanted a tighter fit and it still hides my belly.
2646	1	a	"I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer, so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath, but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1"", and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work, as it hits me slightly above my knees."
2647	1	a	"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i do not love green but this was so different. would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!"
2648	1	a	I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse, jacket and heeled sandals they are professional, with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and do not instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.
2649	1	a	This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
2650	1	a	"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?"
2651	1	a	These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li
2652	1	a	I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. does not come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i'm 5'3 so it is not this short on me. i'm really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets!
2653	1	a	I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
2654	1	a	I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derriﾃ｣ﾂｨre. the swing shape did not overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it a kn
2655	1	a	"Just a heads up because i did not notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i do not really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5"" and the dress came to just barely above my k"
2656	1	a	I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats.
2657	1	a	I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and could not pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.
2658	1	a	I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique. i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.
2659	0	a	Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width does not flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it does not hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.
2660	1	a	Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.
2661	0	a	I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which
2662	1	a	I'm glad i got this skirt because it prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that a bonus. it tts although it longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.
2663	0	a	"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6"", 135lbs, 34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some, but looked like a potato sack on me. also, i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store."
2664	1	a	I tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small. i'm a 34d but very petite body type otherwise and did not feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described. it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time. i liked the feel, colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi
2665	1	a	"I love wearing a dress at thanksgiving but do not want to be too dressy. this was perfect;: casual with a bit of sass and comfortable. it also arm enough and super cute with booties. i'm 5'4"" and small boned. the xs fit perfect."
2666	1	a	"I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6"", petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution did not fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it so cozy."
2667	1	a	"Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i'd say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5'7"" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,"
2668	1	a	This general sweatshirt is cute, stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.
2669	1	a	This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it was not as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it not work appropriate. .
2670	1	a	"I love this dress! i am 5'3"" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture, and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!"
2671	1	a	I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.
2672	1	a	Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering, and the shirt naturally comes away from the body.
2673	1	a	Love the fit and style of this maxi. have gotten many compliments! however, my toddler grabbed the dress when she was falling over and it pulled a bunch of threads out and made the fabric look puckered and worn in that spot!!! for a toddler to do that makes me feel like the quality is not amazing. also, the waist part itches me.
2674	1	a	"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp."
2675	0	a	Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.
2676	1	a	Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition.
2677	1	a	Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality was not as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.
2678	1	a	The moss color intrigued me so i ordered a medium instead of large because it looked oversized. i generally wear a large. medium is a good fit. probably could have ordered the small, but wanted to preserve the draping on the side. this top is very wide but it looks great on. so do size down. love the color variations. it true to the pics and is a nice addition to my casual lifestyle.
2679	1	a	I was so excited for another fun white shirt. this was fits the bill! its cute, it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large. it is also not white, white, has a touch of ivory. still, is a great top with skinny jeans. received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee, the lady was going online to get one for herself!
2680	1	a	Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats, boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9, 138 with an athletic build.
2681	1	a	I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it pretty straight up and down, and i was not sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this did not appear to be so. in truth, it is not, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability
2682	1	a	"Love everything about this. i bought this after reading other reviews. beautiful fabric, i'm 5'10"", 135 and bought the small and fits perfect. it great with heels or flats... seriously just makes you want to twirl, dance, skip, you name it."
2683	0	a	This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this, but it just does not fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
2684	1	a	Looks cute on! not super form fitting... more of a flow fit. love the detailed stitching! so cute! floral pattern is fun not too busy! i loved the pockets... there is a bit of extra material but if you expect a flowy fit it still totally lovely! i was worried about tightness in the arms but not a problem at all!!! i love this dress! lining makes it feel really well made!
2685	1	a	I ordered two pairs of the red cords, one my typical size, one a size smaller in case i found that the pants stretched out. they run true to size and have a nice fit with a high(er) rise waist. the color is beautiful. i did not find that the pants stretched out but they do seem to bunch somewhat which may come from the thickness of the material.
2686	0	a	I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
2687	1	a	After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it on sale, do not hesitate in this purchas
2688	1	a	Great fit, runs maybe a tad big but overall great fit/quality.
2689	1	a	Got the jacket in blue xs, i am 5-1, 110 lbs. fits great and wanted the beige one too! however the beige color ones have a totally different fit! the beige jackets run big and i was swimming in the xs, hence the mixed reviews from other peeps.
2690	1	a	I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer, it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online, it would
2691	1	a	The material is super soft and the color is spot on. i have red hair, so purchasing a top in any red tone can be iffy...great transitional top for spring, summer and fall seasons! i accidentally dried mine, (thankfully only on the lowest heat setting) and it shrunk, but just the length a bit. one of my fave retailer purchases.
2692	1	a	Very nice but thin materal. very sheer. i paired with the palmarosa wide legs. loved the way it looked. i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt, though.
2693	0	a	This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it going back.
2694	1	a	Love this sweater! it is very simple but pretty! it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable.
2695	1	a	"If any of you have read the book or watched the movie ""sisterhood of the traveling pants"" then you will understand this analogy. i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places. it looks kind of boring on a hanger, but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much. i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body. although the design of this dress is casual, i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting. i love basic clothing designs tha"
2696	0	a	I love the look of this jacket. it incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it a little different and fun. however, it already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point, i would have expected better quality.
2697	1	a	I love this dress! i spotted it in the store yesterday right before walking out. i almost missed it! i'm so glad that i did not because this dress is super cute. the fit is nice too. not too short. the fringe detailing is very cool. i cannot wait to wear this dress this spring/summer. casual enough for flip flops, but could also be dressed up with some cute wedge sandals.
2698	1	a	I am a lover of jackets and coats; this is my new fave! great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered
2699	1	a	I love this dress! great fit and quality. love that the skirt is lined. this is a real throw on and go piece. i've worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers. my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat. but overall an amazing dress!
2700	0	a	True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment, or spot clean at best.
2701	1	a	I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i do not always like hanging out there. in all, it perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!
2702	1	a	I bought the wine color. typically wear med or large., med was plenty big.... the color is deep and beautiful. is so soft and flowing. i love it!
2703	1	a	I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders, larger chest) but it not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.
2704	1	a	"The cotton, the print, and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful, i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i do not notice on the model, and that does not flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else, it nearly empire on me. and, there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
2705	1	a	Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. have not had a problem with the sweater up to now!
2706	1	a	"Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite, but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4""."
2707	1	a	Art on a dress- belt on the back makes it interesting
2708	1	a	"This is a beautiful, flattering dress, however i ca not decide whether to keep it or not! as a few other reviewers has mentioned, the transition between the ""top"" and the ""skirt"" is a bit off - it like there is some extra fabric there, and the weight of the skirt pulls it down, making it a little awkward/bunchy. i thought it may have been showing up because i am larger chested (36d), but you can kind of see this on the teal dress image, under the chest where there is an extra fold. i ordered th"
2709	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body. definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape. the color is gorgeous, great print and very light fabric - perfect for summer.
2710	1	a	These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy, stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off, the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!
2711	1	a	I do not know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty
2712	1	a	This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.
2713	1	a	This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.
2714	1	a	This skirt is nicer in person. the fit is a little strange. the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large. i am a curvy size 8 and purchased the 6 based on another review. the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits. it too beautiful to return.
2715	0	a	"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?"
2716	0	a	This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it would not stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
2717	1	a	As the previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is great for a dress that does not have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft, high quality material, and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you ca not tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c
2718	1	a	Ok so this top runs extremely large. for reference,i am a typical medium but i ended up purchasing an extra-small!!! besides the sizing issue, the style is super cute and perfect for any summer occasion whether casual or more formal. i definitely recommend! (ps. beware it does wrinkle easily lol...)
2719	1	a	I wish this came in a petite size! i'm going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i'm busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium.
2720	1	a	I wore this to a wedding yesterday and received several compliments. the dress is well made and very comfortable. i know i will wear it again.
2721	1	a	This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch.
2722	1	a	"Okay, i get the idea of the loose swing dresses but i have a couple that do it well without looking like a moo-moo. i ordered my ""typical"" pxs. the length was good and the color beautiful. i like the details of the dress but it was huge and not in a flattering swingy drapey way. i was undecided if i should try the pxxs as the pxs was so large that i do not know if the pxxs would fix this problem for me. i will still be thinking about it."
2723	1	a	Love everything about this dress except - it runs huge. i am busty and usually wear a 12 in dresses, but the large was completely shapeless on me. will try medium and hope it is better bc otherwise i love the dress!!
2724	1	a	I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o
2725	1	a	I caught this on sale and bought the light pink version. it is very lightweight and delicate. i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape / design- but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy. it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a t-shirt on the weekend. the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater- it does feel more
2726	1	a	Love this tank. it nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it very forgiving if you have a midsection. it soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.
2727	1	a	I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder.
2728	1	a	I do like the shape of this piece. it is eye catching due to the length and flattering. however, if you are chesty, this piece shows off more than i was comfy with, and i do not think i've ever had that problem with retailer. in the body, i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it. but up top, the xs showed much too much cleavage. (34d, 5', 115). i'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this.
2729	1	a	I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic, but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8, to give you an idea. i would recommend it, but it is going back for me.
2730	0	a	Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
2731	1	a	This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly, the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile.
2732	1	a	Super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have.
2733	1	a	This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b
2734	1	a	This was such a great top! see thoughts below!___________pros:- fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'9, 36c, hourglass. i'm normally a m or l (10 or 12) depending on the fit and found the medium to fit well and not be too tight at all. i could have probably sized down for a snugger fit, but i like the looseness. fit very well across the chest and arms.- the sleeves are surprisingly flattering. i've dealt with other tops where the sleeves flutter too much and adds too much weight and attentio
2735	1	a	"I love this skirt for so many reasons! one, it is not a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and do not need extra volume at my hips. so while it called a circle skirt, the description states that it a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it exactly at my knee; perfect for me."
2736	1	a	I love paige jeans and these are no exception. the wash is so so great - a faded black/charcoal grey. it like having two pairs of jeans in one! i am normally a 26 in most jeans and that what i took in these. highly recommend!
2737	1	a	These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but wo not rip further. i wear these at least once a week.
2738	1	a	This is a pretty jump suit, true to size, looked flattering on me, lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however, the sides are cut too deep and it impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely does not work, so back it went to the store.
2739	1	a	Great feeling trench. can dress it up or down.just be prepared to take a steamer with you. it comes wrinkled and will wrinkle very easy.
2740	1	a	These are such under-rated pants! i love the fit, style, fabric & everything about them. they are the perfect weight & can be worn with boots, sandals, flats, etc. they run tts - i got my usual 26. get yourself a pair while they last. you wo not regret it.
2741	1	a	I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday. i thought the design was fluid, summer appropriate, and easy like sunday morning. i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color. and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizing/fit. i totally respect other reviewers, so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday, so much so that i went and put it on again, sans issues.i am n
2742	1	a	"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger"
2743	1	a	I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it- i was thinking black, tank top dress. after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head, i started to branch out. i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be 'baggish', plain, and possibly too short. wow was i wrong!! this dress is everything + more. wear with some wedges, belt it (although it does not need it at all!), layer a high neckline lace top over it, the possibilities are endless. although i loved the green, the b
2744	1	a	My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
2745	1	a	I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses, with jeans or skirts all year round!
2746	1	a	Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.
2747	1	a	I love the look of this dress but wish the bottom was lined like the top is. it a little sheer without the lining.
2748	1	a	"Simply perfect. i ordered the white floral maillot in a large (5'6""-ish, 145 pounds) and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off. the colors are so vibrant and accurate, which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person. i do recommend ordering a size up -- the medium was snug, but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet. now that they have a new print -- hello fish!! -- i really really want another!"
2749	1	a	This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i could not beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.
2750	1	a	This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i ca not comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.
2751	1	a	Love this dress. very comfortable and stylish. wanted my size. but they only had a size larger available. still bought it, but feel good in it. glad i purchased it.
2752	1	a	Beautiful top that will go with anything. looking forward to wearing it.
2753	1	a	The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye on-line, but was not available in the store, so i tried the green one, mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small. i did have to size up one or two sizes. i fell in love with the green dress and bought it. it is so comfortable, great quality fabric (not too thin or too heavy). looks great on. i have received several compliments.
2754	0	a	"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews, i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist, it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
2755	1	a	These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.
2756	1	a	I loved this top, but had to return because the stiff applique made me look like a linebacker! i wish it could have worked out, because this is a cool top. if this particular design works for you, go for it!
2757	1	a	I love love this top. it is a very pretty casual top. it looks very nice on and is more like a tunic. perfect with jeans, very casual but the embroidery, ruffle sleeves, and buttons at the top add a nice touch. i have the red, i am considering buying this in blue as well, i have so many newly purchased blue tops!
2758	1	a	I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it comfortable and it cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.
2759	0	a	"I did not have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'"
2760	1	a	These are the perfect high-waisted skinny jeans. they fit tts and do not stretch out. are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots. i adore them!
2761	1	a	"I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress, as it taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it drapey but not voluminous, with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders, but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest, and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee."
2762	1	a	This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.
2763	1	a	"I bought this dress as a birthday present to myself which i wore to a recent weekend vacation to dallas, texas and i absolutely love it. i love the color and the design of the dress as i think it is timeless and i will get a lot of use out of it for years to come. however, this dress is tight in the chest area and i would recommend sizing up. i am 5'10"", 156 pounds, and usually wear a us size 6, but when i tried this dress on in a size 6 the dress stopped buttoning up underneath my bust. i end"
2764	1	a	It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so ca not say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.
2765	0	a	"I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips."
2766	0	a	The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i do not like the sleeve length or the top style, it just did not look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
2767	1	a	"Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that 1 front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it the ""retailer unique touch"". i do not mind abt that. it too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really did not need another itchy swtr, so returned. no worry, retailer has plenty of other items of interest!"
2768	1	a	Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!
2769	1	a	The photo of this dress does not do it justice. this dress is absolutely gorgeous. the construction is very high quality. i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty. total non-issue with this dress. the petite fit is also spot on. it is slightly large in the back bodice for me, but i always have that problem. it an easy tailoring fix.i think i'm in love with byron lars <3
2770	1	a	This is a great white dress for summer.i tried on a 4 in store and it was too big for me especially in the underarm area. when i tried on the 2, it fit perfectly. i almost felt like there should be a 3, ha ha, because it felt like it made more of a difference to downsize than i expected. that being said, i took the 2 home since it looked like it was tailored to fit my body (but not in a super tight way).fyi, i'm not super curvy. if you have a larger chest you may need your regular size.
2771	1	a	This robe is exactly what i was looking for. it perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off. it is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but that fine for me. only downside is that it has to be hand washed.
2772	1	a	These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits greatthe tie dye is very unique love it!
2773	1	a	I'm an xl in retailer blouses, and this blouse is the same. i'm guessing women with a thin frame might size down, but i ca not say for sure. i purchased the white blouse with the floral pattern. there is a narrow band on the bottom, but it is not tight, so i did not find it to be a problem. i usually do not like blouses with banded bottoms, but this is loose. the band does cause the blouse to blouse out a bit, but the fabric has a really nice drape to it, so it worked fine. the fabric has a gre
2774	1	a	Classic retailer stunning dress! the embroidery is beautiful, with the beads and details. the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion, but i did not have trouble with this. i got a ton of compliments. it looks a bit flat on top on the model. i'm not very curvy, and it accentuates my curves nicely. it does not hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture, but has a more classic fit and flare shape, very flattering.
2775	1	a	I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it. it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties. the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well. the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it. the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included. i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures. i think that the looks are
2776	1	a	I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable, warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing, i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.
2777	1	a	This is an amazingly soft and gorgeous sweater. i typically avoid this brand because most of their pieces run smaller on my frame however this not only fit perfect but it is a beautiful color as well! i prefer transitional pieces that can be worn multiple seasons and this one is just right.
2778	1	a	I love these overalls but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
2779	1	a	The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you wo not dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what does not show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the
2780	1	a	I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the did not quite button over my bust, and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem, medium it is.
2781	1	a	This top is beautiful. soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner. i am usually a 4, but sized up to an 8 to get a little more length. it drapes really nicely. i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual, put-together look or it can be dressed up easily, too. i'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline. it lays perfectly on me. highly recommend.
2782	1	a	"Confused and a little disappointed because the s is too tight in my shoulders and the m is too big all around. weird because i'm a 39"" chest+breasts so m should not look that baggy on me. please sanctuary, make a petite version, maybe that will solve my issue. otherwise, this jacket is soft and relaxed and has no distracting collar. price point is bit over indulgent for what it is combined with my issues. who knows, maybe i'll try again?!?"
2783	1	a	This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
2784	1	a	I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!
2785	1	a	This is a beautiful, high-quality little black dress. it actually has a little weight to it, but nothing bothersome. i usually take a medium across the board, but i had to size up to a large. this is dress has more of a straight line versus a-line and i have wider hips, so the large fit really good. it beautiful and versatile. i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments : ) great purchase, i would highly recommend.
2786	1	a	I'm not a big fan of rompers but love this one. it is very flattering and comfortable. i love that you can dress it up with some heels and accessorizes or more casual with flats.
2787	0	a	The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
2788	1	a	"Love these jeans!! i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away! i ordered the 26 regular.yes, they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2""# for flats, but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2"" - 3"" to wear with these).the fit is comfortable, they stretch just enough to look nice and still move with you. they are not binding at all.the first time i wore them i got so many compliments. i even had a friend tell me she did not understand why flares were coming back because she t"
2789	1	a	This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!
2790	0	a	I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy, cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly, but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.
2791	1	a	"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you ca not really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"
2792	1	a	I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture, which makes it more interesting.
2793	1	a	"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they do not get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i have not worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte"
2794	1	a	The fabric on this tee is a very very soft thin cotton knit. it perfect for those hot, muggy summers esp. in the southern area of the us. the sizing runs larger. i am normally an xl and because of the other reviews saying it ran big, i got this in a l. and, it fits me fine, and there room to spare. so, if you are a size 16 or 18, this will fit in a l nicely.it thin but i do not think it immodest or too sheer. a white or beige bra would not show through this easily at all. the leng
2795	1	a	Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary.
2796	1	a	"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)i bought my usual size 4 and it fit perfectly. like other reviewers said, this is a very fine corduroy fabric. the thicker fabric really helps smooth any bumps and bulges, and the a-line skirt was flattering. overall i liked this dress, but the color did not do much for me. because it just was not ""wow"" on me, i found little things to nitpick. the bodice is very flattering, but the way it cuts in shows bra-straps ("
2797	1	a	Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that what i usually wear.
2798	1	a	The dress did not look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but
2799	1	a	I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.
2800	1	a	"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i ca not wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days."
2801	1	a	Great basic item. can be worn with leggings or pants, dressed up or down, or layered on. fit and color are true to size and picture.
2802	1	a	"I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall, (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself."
2803	1	a	"This dress fit perfectly and as i am a bit curvy the style compliments my figure. it is a bit fuller in the bottom than the photo looks. also, i am 5'4"" and it is a right to the bottom of my knees which is also very complimentary."
2804	1	a	"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac"
2805	1	a	This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way
2806	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.
2807	1	a	It beautiful, lovely quality, gorgeous bird. but the fit just does not work for me. i'm usually a medium, which is what i got, it just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
2808	1	a	Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.
2809	1	a	Cute and differentlooks good beltedwill try with lace leggings
2810	1	a	...on this great vest. i wear it all the time. it soft, pretty, warm and durable. love!
2811	1	a	I ordered this on a whim and did not expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,
2812	0	a	"I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its ""chunkiness,"" it does not tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model."
2813	1	a	I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.
2814	1	a	I love this dress. the colors are beautiful. i find it hard to find dresses that are knee length and with sleeves and flattering. this is all three. my only complaint is sleeves are a bit long but overall...awesome!
2815	1	a	These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90 that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...
2816	1	a	"Just picked this up at a store....had a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray. super soft fabric and not too short for a 55 year old. i'm 5'5"", 135 lbs, and 34 d and the medium is perfect. sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this. i'll wear without a belt...it falls nicely and is very flattering!"
2817	1	a	"Tried the blue motif, size 6, regular.i'm 5'6"" and if i were shorter i'd go with petite sizing.stats: 34a-28-36 with broad shoulders, sometimes i go up to a size 8 in blazers but this was a perfect fit. side pockets, dress is unlined and quite lightweight. the tie has to be tied in back and i liked the clean lines this gives in front. nice and simple for when it warms up!"
2818	1	a	This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone. pairs amazing with leather boots and hat
2819	1	a	"I do not usually go for the ""tenty"" cut in a blouse, but this one has such pretty detail and with a little cardy, looks great! love the black and white detail and embroidery."
2820	0	a	It was cute. i did not keep it because it was not soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
2821	1	a	In true cloth & stone fashion, this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small, but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it easy to launder (machine wash), and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down, depending on how you accessorize the product. i ca not wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.
2822	1	a	I could not wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .
2823	1	a	This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i do not see it as a design flaw.
2824	0	a	I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes, no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve
2825	1	a	Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality
2826	1	a	I was not sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist did not fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these, either. i have slim legs- if you do not, i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
2827	1	a	I've been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect. one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress (it looks even better in person!). the material is a thicker, almost canvas-y type of fabric, which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me. i love how comfortable the dress is and it so easy to throw it on and look amazing. i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti
2828	1	a	The colors and design of this skirt are beautiful. the fabric hangs nicely. the color i more burnt orange than red. i ordered my usual size (6), but it is too small.
2829	0	a	Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
2830	1	a	I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.
2831	1	a	The dress is as great 'in person' as it shows in the pictures. if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look. if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get. i am 5.3, 117 lbs and tried both, xs regular and xs petite. i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer length.everything about this dress is perfect, the color, the material, the cut. highly recommended as a transition
2832	1	a	"I tried this dress on in store, and i realized it is true to size in every way. i am 5'1 and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee. this dress was elegant- i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a ""rent the runway"" dress! ha! i'm way to classy for that. for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events, this is your dress! i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues! the clasps go all the way down the dress, so i do suggest (li"
2833	1	a	This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. ca not wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and ca not wait to wear!
2834	1	a	"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!"
2835	0	a	"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible."
2836	1	a	I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i do not even care because it so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.
2837	1	a	Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s
2838	1	a	This is a very cute tunic, but it is slit so high on the sides. i really like the fit, but i think i'm going to return it because it is slit so high.
2839	1	a	"I bought this dress in ivory and then bought the navy on sale, i loved it so much. i'm 5'4"", 117, and the petite medium was perfect. love the kicky flare, and the lining makes it so comfortable. an effortless, fun dress - perfect for hot summer lunch."
2840	0	a	This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it not flattering at all, and it completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i ca not imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
2841	0	a	"I really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them. i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric. i am 5'5"" and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long. i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am. the fabric is nice, not as dark as the photo as others have said."
2842	1	a	Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big
2843	1	a	This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind, it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.
2844	1	a	This top works very well with a white or green cardigan for work. the color is more green than in the photo and it is wider on the bottom. it hides a non-flat stomach very well without looking matronly. i ordered a small petite, but i am heavy on top so i did not find the armhole problem that the other reviewer had. my only con is that i do not love the high-low thing that every retailer top seems to have these days, but i can live with it.
2845	1	a	Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.
2846	0	a	Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it does not look anything like the phot
2847	1	a	"Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27"" waist, 37"" hips. it a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! could not resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look"
2848	1	a	I love this shirt! it super comfy and i love the design and detail. it does run large, so order a size down.
2849	1	a	"I love the way this dress fits and flows! it does run big. i normally wear size 6 in retailer dresses. had to downsize to 6p. for reference, i'm 5'10"" and 34c. the pink color is 1 shade darker than shown in the pictures.there was a tear in fabric along the zipper. called for replacing the dress. the sales rep was very pleasant & agreed to send another one!"
2850	1	a	Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there a sz sm in stock.
2851	1	a	The dress has an awesome fit and the perfect length. it easy to make it more classy with a summer cardigan.
2852	1	a	Fits like a dream: not too tight, not too loose. arm holes are not too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses), the sweater material is not itchy, and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe.
2853	1	a	This dress is adorable, but fit a bit large through the waist. i ordered the 6 and am exchanging for the 4, so hopefully it will work better for me. for reference, i am 5'7, 135 lbs curvy. the fabric is soft and swingy and the striped under-layer is feminine and adorable. love.
2854	1	a	Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve
2855	1	a	Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!
2856	1	a	Got this dress in the mail today, and it definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.
2857	0	a	"Soft, cozy, and cute, but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only.for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money.i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1"". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs, but i was ok with it being looser."
2858	1	a	Easy and fun jumper. runs slightly large. i ordered a medium and returned for a small. can be dressed up or down for a variety of occasions. would be perfect if it had pockets.
2859	1	a	Love this--the chunky ribs, the retro striping, the conservative neckline. all of it. comfy, casual 70-on-the-slopes vibe. leaving the house in it today wich maroon cords and chunky boots. so cute!
2860	1	a	Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. did not need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
2861	1	a	I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i would not go up to xs p... to give an idea. material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!
2862	1	a	So, this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said, all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely, and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!
2863	1	a	If i had not seen the description online, i would never have known these pants were navy! i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.since i'm heavy around the stomach, i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid
2864	0	a	Super soft, super cute but too short for a dress, too long and too overwhelming for a shirt, and did not like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors, feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.
2865	1	a	I know it a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.
2866	1	a	I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you wo not be sorry you bought!
2867	0	a	I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model, but when i received it, it actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. does not work very well on my body. i'm 5'3, 123 lbs., 34-d. it going back.
2868	0	a	"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures,or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular, and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops, and, had i kept this, i would have gone with the m.----------this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi, the v neck is very de"
2869	1	a	This dress is very flattering and tts. i bought this dress for my brother wedding at the end of june. i love that it is machine washable, which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another. as another reviewer already mentioned, it is brighter than photographed.
2870	1	a	"The fabric is divine. it a thin polyester knit that just floats on your body. it soft and drapes wonderfully. it like wearing a nightgown. the styling is so sexy. it looks really alluring but it actually just a plain ol' tank top with a bit of a sleeve dangling at the elbows. it very modest really.the silly thing is, it tickles! yeah those dangling ties tickle your arms when you move. loli bought the grey in a xl and the fit is perfect. it says ""dark grey"" but it really l"
2871	1	a	"As other reviewers have mentioned, this dress runs extremely large. i'm a solid medium in maeve dresses usually and got this dress in the store in a size x-small... and took it to my local seamstress to get it taken in! i get that this is supposed to be a ""swingy"" and ""airy"" dress but there was just too much space and material for me. i loved the top and the soft material so i am ok with spending money to get the waist taken in. i think this would be the perfect dress for someone with a slim fig"
2872	1	a	"Only thing is the fit is a little loose, so i wish the xxs petite was not sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs, i tried on e xs regular, that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice, but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it, just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite, we shall see.the navy and beige is a nice classy combo, i could see it being pulled off in all seasons, depending how you pair it."
2873	1	a	The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
2874	1	a	This is a perfect dress for summer in florida. it does run larger than it needs to be, even for a swing dress. no problem, i took in the sides several inches on each side, and it looks great. it very easy to pick the stitches on the straps and make them adjustable.it has a nice, lightweight full lining. my new favorite dress.
2875	1	a	Love the coral color of this shirt. only wish it was a little longer in the front. falls right to my jeans waistline.
2876	1	a	Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me, fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it.
2877	1	a	This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you ca not see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.
2878	0	a	I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest, as the waist hits a bit high.the color is vibrant...i wanted to like!
2879	1	a	This coat is cool, the cut is classic and well fit. i've been wearing it as a jacket every day since purchasing 3 days ago. it already has begun to slightly pill. i have not worn this under other jackets, so it pilling quickly from very basic wear.
2880	1	a	I love this sweater coat! the buttons make it more structured and practical when the weather is cool.the colors are even nicer in person; the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lot.you would be disappointed with this purchase.
2881	1	a	Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
2882	1	a	This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!
2883	1	a	"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it not that it runs big it supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov"
2884	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty. the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down, it still looks great. i think i'm going to be wearing this dress all summer. love, love, love. i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself, and when i was walking it rode up (it like a stretchy mesh type material). but i'm carrying a few more pounds than i'd like right now. once i lo
2885	1	a	"I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2"") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i do not like anything to hug my body. but it does not look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also."
2886	1	a	Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality, beautiful design, flattering!
2887	1	a	"These pants are beautiful and very comfortable. i am 5'3"" and 120, ordered an extra small. i had to hem them because they are extremely long, otherwise the fit is great."
2888	1	a	I could live in this top: it versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.
2889	1	a	"In agreement with all the reviewers before me, this dress is gorgeous!i am 5'4"" 120lbs 34a and got this is in a size 0 and it fits perfectly but i would be in a little bit of trouble if i were significantly larger up top, so if you are, definitely size up.the material is thick, structured and very well made. every time i wear this out i get a ton of compliments!one of my favorite parts about it is the intricate embroidery on the neck-line that gives the illusion that you are wearing a necklac"
2890	1	a	I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.
2891	1	a	I love the color of this top. it is a dark olive green and elegant. i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans. it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time.
2892	1	a	You want to buy this! it so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!
2893	1	a	I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it true to size. it not skintight but it also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!
2894	1	a	The fabric is very soft and the fit is formed to the body. low cut, so may want to pair with a cami. great basic for work!
2895	1	a	"I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2"" and ordered a petite, but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also, the rise is relatively low. otherwise, the quality is great, and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed."
2896	0	a	What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest, this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.
2897	0	a	I had mixed feelings about this dress. the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd. it has two slips, one that fits close and a second that a bit too puffy. so the skirt did not sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger. the odd length made it unflattering. it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i did not want to risk it.
2898	1	a	I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee
2899	1	a	I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first, but i'm happy i did. they are higher quality than the typical legging. the sizing runs bigger than average.
2900	1	a	Looks nearly exactly like the picture. will be very comfortable to wear. i ordered a petite large and could really have worn a medium. it big all over. i figure i'll do a little tailoring on this come spring and adjust the fit. on the whole, happy.
2901	1	a	"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:___________pros:- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.- there a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i do not see why that needed since you can just slip it over your head.- front ""v slit"" is not too low or reve"
2902	0	a	Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/were not smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
2903	1	a	Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.
2904	0	a	These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
2905	1	a	Like the swingy fit. looks nice with a long fitted tee underneath and skinny jeans. the color online says black but it looks more like a faded black like it has been washed too many times.
2906	0	a	Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still did not hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.
2907	1	a	"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit, long and not clingy at all. i love the 80 motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.the black design was strange - hearts, fox, cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well, but the black ""green"" design was too off."
2908	1	a	This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that only the case for c cup a
2909	1	a	This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it.
2910	0	a	Beautiful color, design and fit. but i could not wait to get it off. i do not have sensitive skin and do not recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
2911	1	a	I've ordered a pair of these from the catalog and loved them. on my next visit to a store, i picked up another color. i'm now considering getting another pair while the free shipping deal is going on. they are great pants with a great fit.
2912	1	a	I have to say, this sweater is gorgeous!!! i bought it in the green motif and absolutely loved the variety of colors used. i just did not like the fit. it was so... blah. i felt like an old lady wearing it... it really had no flare to it... it was pretty boxy and boring :( so, very unfortunately, this one went back. way too much $$$ to not be in love w/it!
2913	1	a	This jacket is a show stopper. great fabric, beautiful embroidery. well worth the price.
2914	1	a	I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky, but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique, but still basic, this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis.
2915	1	a	This shirt is even prettier in person. it really flowy but still very flattering.
2916	1	a	I was not sure what size to get in this and how it would fit since there were not any reviews but i ordered it in a size 10 and it fits really well. i usually get dresses in a size 8 but those flow a bit more and this on my waist (am curvy on bottom) i needed to get the 10, it sits well on my waist and i do not have to hike it up. the material is chino like so it does get a bit wrinkled but it has a nice weight and the pleats give it a pretty flow not too boxy making my hips look bigger. it has bel
2917	0	a	I love the colors in this top, but i returned it for a few reasons. the material is extremely fragile; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it. my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me. i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top. i'm 5'6 and it just did not look that way on me.
2918	1	a	This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you ca not layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!
2919	1	a	This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length ,even though i got the regular and not the petite.
2920	0	a	This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
2921	1	a	These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties, i love the rise, and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine have not stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had), and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.
2922	1	a	I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it very cute on.
2923	1	a	"Probably not for everyone but boy do i love it and i've gotten loads of compliments on it! looks best with skinny jeans, would be good with leggings also.i am 5'7"", 155# and bought a size 10, fits perfectly!"
2924	0	a	I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.
2925	0	a	Material is very thin, and although this is apparent in the design, i just did not like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
2926	1	a	Was not sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did.it is much prettier in person. soft and silky.great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)
2927	1	a	I tried these on at the store and the fit was good, the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton, which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs, so it was not ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half.
2928	1	a	"I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5"" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with"
2929	1	a	This tee is a great everyday staple. it is comfortable and it also drapes very well. i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular. the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black. the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better. you ca not go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well.
2930	0	a	I love this sweater rich color and good quality, but the fabric is very thick and heavy, the neck opening is too wide, and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.
2931	1	a	I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!
2932	1	a	Have to disagree with previous posters. i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer (someone returned it from online) and it was adorable on. got many compliments in the dressing room area. other customers asked if there were more available but it turns out it an online exclusive. it does have a zipper. i recommend sizing up not because it runs small (i think it pretty true to size) but i think it looks better a bit loose/drapery. fabric is soft and pretty. tailoring is f
2933	1	a	I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned. they are the perfect length. they are very well made. i have worn them to my son baseball game and the sec tournament. they are tailored and have an interesting design. they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds. i am thrilled with them.
2934	1	a	This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i did not consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.
2935	1	a	"This coat wo not take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most ""runs small"" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is"
2936	1	a	This is a great top and got compliments already...it does have a longer sleeve like the picture, butreally not bad. it so comfortable and color is fabulous. great with any scarf too.
2937	0	a	I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it is not the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.
2938	1	a	This is a nice everyday jacket to wear with dresses, jeans, skirts, anything. i ordered the only color that had petite left, the plum. i liked it, but the fit was a little boxy, even as xs petite. length was nice, however. color was also a nice neutral, though it says plum, it is a darker brown. for reference, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs - review on xsp.
2939	1	a	I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they do not fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.
2940	1	a	This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.
2941	1	a	The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.
2942	1	a	I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale, but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well. it a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time. it looks about the same as it does on the model color/fit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar, which makes it more interesting. i'm 6ft tall 160lb, ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized, but with tha
2943	1	a	There just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.
2944	1	a	"This dress is really flattering on. fits true to size. perfect length, i'm 5'6"" & dress hits just a few inches above my knees. it simple, yet versatile seasonally. right now i plan to wear it with booties & sandals in the spring."
2945	1	a	"Love this dress - ""swingy"" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down."
2946	1	a	I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it. i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)i love it. it still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50 is the perfect temps for it. i rarely say this but i do not think the photos of the coat above do it justice.
2947	0	a	I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!
2948	1	a	I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well
2949	1	a	"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
2950	1	a	Bought the red/white. normally a size small but they were out so tried a medium. it fit perfectly. and feels amazing. love how it hangs and know i will get lots of compliments on this! jeans, white linen pants, very versatile how this can be warn.
2951	1	a	I bought this sweater in the sky color. just love it, i'll go back for the rust colored one.
2952	1	a	I liked the details on the front a d back of this top. while i was pregnant i purchased the white color in the small. everything fit, suprisingly, the top even covered up my pregnant belly. i returned it since i did not want a top with so much room in the waist area post pregnancy. i recently got this top in the xs thinking that it will be a great stylish breasting top. while everything fit in the hips, and waist, the chest area was too tight. this top did not work for me as i am in between sizes
2953	1	a	Very cute shirt, but the white is see through. i could see every detail on my bra. i returned for the pink, which is just as cute.
2954	0	a	"I really wanted to like this top, but could not seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a ""crop top"""
2955	1	a	This dress is gorgeous! it is a little sheer even though it has many layers.
2956	1	a	"This sweater is really cute, and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it a deeper blue than i was expecting, and the pocket is not a ""rust"" color as depicted online. it definitely closer to red. other than that, i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch, and it is true to size, and not too short."
2957	1	a	"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1"", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i would not want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with"
2958	1	a	I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.
2959	1	a	I love, love, love this top! it is beautiful and very unique. the first day i wore it i got so many compliments! highly recommend!
2960	0	a	"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high, the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally, the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits, and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt, given the pretty steep price."
2961	1	a	I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.
2962	1	a	When i saw this dress online, i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5'4, 34b, 27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which is not typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress
2963	1	a	I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
2964	1	a	This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
2965	1	a	Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!
2966	1	a	I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter would not have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.
2967	1	a	This sweater jacket is beautiful! i was not going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy, but i am so glad i did. it super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt. i have a petite frame, and it does not look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do. totally recommend this one!
2968	1	a	"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it warm, but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""definitely worth the purchase on sale."
2969	0	a	These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
2970	1	a	"This shirt runs a little big, i bought it for my niece who usually wears a medium , but the small fit her. she is tall and this was a nice length on her.it very comfortable and is a a perfect staple to send her off to college with. i paired it with the nouveau belt in silver- as an option for her to wear it with- great buy!my niece is 5' 11"" with an athletic build."
2971	1	a	I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!
2972	1	a	I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it just below my knees and i think it perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that what i love about retailerpolog
2973	1	a	This is a truly exquisite top. it looks exactly as it does online with cascades of delicately embroidered flowers on front and back and a slightly ruffled neck. very chic and versatile with skirts or pants.material is very light and chiffon like and it fully lined so no need for a cami. it ever so slightly see-through in the sections that are not embroidered but only in very intense light.it fits tts, i usually get petite sizes but i got a xxs regular because i wanted a longer length and
2974	1	a	This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!
2975	0	a	Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you
2976	1	a	"I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not"
2977	1	a	I'd been eyeing this dress for a while, wondering if it could work for me. i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale. its pretty perfect-i am 5'4' and currently 130 lbs. it fits well, if a touch loose in the waist, but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust, as it fairly fitted there. the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear, which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular (that and the length), but i can
2978	1	a	I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.
2979	1	a	"I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket. i love it! i am usually ""large"" by retailer brand standards at 5'4"" 145 lbs, but the small fit quite big and i'm glad i did not go for the larger one. it is super unique and cozy. i gave it a 3 on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers. it also is longer than i expected, it hits about my mid thigh."
2980	1	a	While the cut, drape, and shape of this dress are very attractive, seeing the fabric in person was disappointing to me. it clearly well-made and there are abundant high-quality details. however, the combination of a large-ish pattern and the wrinkly, thin cotton still felt kind of limp and cheap. i sent it back.
2981	1	a	"I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees, etc. are extra long, so it nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5"" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot."
2982	1	a	"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger, i may have bought it just for lounging, but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me, but cute for teens and early 20."
2983	1	a	When this poncho first came online i ordered it in the xs/s, my usual size. i was a little disappointed that the point in the front oddly hung low & was off-center. the back was centered. i returned it. when i spotted them at the store recently, i tried on a few in the xs/s to compare & see how others hung. i found that one of them hung fine in the front (centered), the back was a little off center which was fine. it soft & comfy, love the soft white color & border trim. it just perfect!
2984	1	a	My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i do not want to be in the sun too long, it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!
2985	1	a	This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4, 120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater did not feel too scratchy but it not a soft sweater. very feminine.
2986	0	a	"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model black underwear."
2987	1	a	Surprised that this is a fall/winter dress. the embroidery is beautiful but the material is not that thick and the tie at the waist is unusual. would have been better if rather than having the tie built into the dress it was separate.
2988	1	a	"This is a really unique floreat top. unfortunately the petite sizes sold out so i went with an xs. this was too big?too wide in the shoulders and chest, all around actually. my other issue is that it a heavy material. i just feel like if i was wearing it around all day, i might burn up in it. it did not feel like it was breathable. and finally, i'm 5'2""?even the xs was too long in the back. i could see how this could look really cool on the right person?i'm just not that person to pull it"
2989	1	a	"This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s"
2990	1	a	I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i
2991	1	a	Just recd the neutral & navy in the size s, my usual size in tops at retailer. just a heads up - it way oversized under the arms. in the fashion world probably falls under the category of a dolman style sleeve. also the fabric is nubby like/pilled look. similar fabric is the 'warm-up pullover' that i recently saw at the store. i have a feeling this may be a new trend. if you are ok w/ the oversized underarms & nubby fabric then order up. if hesitant, wait & visit the store... i love the look of
2992	1	a	I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
2993	1	a	Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.
2994	0	a	I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons wo not pull at the ch
2995	0	a	This is an adorable top, but it just was not my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
2996	1	a	This is a wonderfully-made top. i love the colors! if you are busty you must size up! this fabric does not give (stretch) at all.
2997	0	a	This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just did not look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
2998	1	a	"These are so much better than i anticipated! they are lightweight for summer, the perfect length (i'm 5'7"" and they are just right with a 2"" wedge), and very flattering. i will be living in these all summer long! i agree with the other reviewer who felt the catalog picture misrepresented them. they do not have a technicolor sheen at all. rather, they are a beautiful, classic chambray."
2999	1	a	I love this dress. i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it. must buy.
3000	1	a	Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!
3001	1	a	"I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it. i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly! i am 5'2"", 120# with broad shoulders. loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels. definitely a keeper! as a petite gal, this was not overly long. if you have larger hips, this will not hang well."
3002	1	a	I love, love, love this skirt. it comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that a plus!
3003	0	a	"I could not wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen, appliquﾃ｣ﾂｩ, pockets, raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium, for reference i am 5'4"" 135 and usually wear a six or a small."
3004	0	a	As soon as i saw this dress, i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it, i noticed it was slightly small, but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it, but honestly a dress should not start falling apart before you even wear it. it cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one, but now it sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
3005	1	a	These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70 vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!
3006	1	a	I know that some folks said it runs small, but i am usually a size small or medium in dresses and the medium feels big to me. that being said, it definitely works, and i think it'll be great. excited to dress it up with accessories- feels professional enough for me to teach in.
3007	1	a	I ordered xs/s. i usually wear medium in tops and coats. the next size up would've been too big so this cape does run large.
3008	1	a	Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee lengthi am typically a 10-12but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own alreadymore petite, less curvy girls enjoy!its going back,sorry!
3009	1	a	If you are looking for a nice vest, this vest is nice enough, comfortable, and soft. the cut is also flattering, but i just did not think it was as special as i wanted. it looks like many other options out there, so i decided to pass.xs fit me at 115 lbs.
3010	0	a	Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
3011	1	a	I must agree with some of the other reviewers--this sweater is so pretty! but the quality of the sweater is not great. my sensitive skin found it to be itchy. so sadly i had to return it.
3012	1	a	"I love the concept of this dress. i love the stripes, ruffle hem and little cut up detail. but it runs huge. i'm 5'3"", 148 lbs, and typically wear a 6-8. i went with the xs in this dress. it flairs out significantly near the waist and hips which makes it super comfortable, but not the most flattering. i wish they had tapered it in slightly to give it a slightly more fitted look. i'm keeping it and think it will be cute with booties in the fall. but i'm not 100% on it"
3013	1	a	These menswear inspired trouser and beyond cute and comfy. great color and fit. soft interior. dress up with a blazer or go casua with a tee. adorable.
3014	1	a	These jeans are great quality, but they just hit too low for me to be comfortable.
3015	1	a	Love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris - felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small - i'm 5'7, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.
3016	1	a	Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress
3017	0	a	The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.
3018	1	a	I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye
3019	1	a	Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!
3020	1	a	I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online, and decided to order it. the fabric is soft, but strong, and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.
3021	1	a	"Just got these jeans last week. love the quality, which is typical of pilcro jeans. i usually have to get a tall size, being 5'10"", however they sold out quickly. so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size. they fit great. since they are more of a boyfriend jean, they do not fit too snug. so i'm able to get away with the regular inseam. i'm usually a 26-27 tall, and the 27 regular works. love the cuffs and rise in the jeans. i've worn with booties, heels...and am waiting for warm w"
3022	0	a	I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......it runs really bigit short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.fabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewn.i have not one positive thing to say about t
3023	1	a	The lighter tinted denim is a faded blue-grey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe, and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear. these feel like stretchy jeans to me, not leggings. i wear size 28 in most jeans and these fit tts. really nice.
3024	1	a	Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.
3025	1	a	Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. this is a great top for the weekends!
3026	1	a	Beautiful maxi fits tts. i normally wear a 10/12 and took a 12. it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly. the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my 5'9 frame.
3027	0	a	I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt does not seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it is not it makes you look very boxy. i do not know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.
3028	1	a	"I have been wearing joe jean for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe. recently, 3 pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability. i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger, my size has been sold out. finally, all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joe skinny ""adieu"" and i was able to purchase"
3029	1	a	I love boys and arrows, but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because there no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support. also, the fabric is super soft, which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost! for my 32d i chose a different design.
3030	1	a	I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i did not expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.
3031	1	a	This dress has the perfect amount of swing to it that it hides a stomach - which i looooove! the blue chambray color is beautiful and it is lined partially. so here what i do not like - this dress would have been so much better fully lined. now it could just be that i am extra sensitive to fabric and find it to be a bit itchy where the ruching is on the upper back of the dress. but i somehow ca not get myself to take it off the hanger to wear it....i may just be returning this dress.
3032	1	a	I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
3033	1	a	This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but did not want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.
3034	1	a	I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i did not feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue
3035	1	a	I tried this on at the store, and though it was pretty, i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea, but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
3036	1	a	Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly do not know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means, like linen it does give with wear, so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you wo not see your straps and i would dryel this, no washing of any kind, linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up.
3037	1	a	I did not buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it. great color, great quality, great fit. oh and great price too! i say - go for it.
3038	1	a	Super soft, light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.
3039	1	a	I'm happy i bought this top. it very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women.
3040	1	a	These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.
3041	1	a	"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!"
3042	1	a	Pretty top. quality material, it is not thin and see through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy, if you do not size down, the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
3043	0	a	"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person, i bet you are not going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs, this dress is not too short. however, the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so."
3044	1	a	Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!
3045	1	a	I did not plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large, i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. do not think i will, though.
3046	1	a	I'm so excited about this dress! it perfect for the summer. the material is so soft and lightweight, with a great lining. i ordered a small petite and it fits great! the ruching in the front is not overdone, so you do not have to worry about adding bulk in the midsection. no problem with my bra (32dd) showing in the back either.
3047	1	a	This top is beautiful. at the present price, grab it. the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything. the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.
3048	1	a	I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it very comfortable and light.
3049	1	a	So glad i finally bought this! love it!!! and have received many compliments. wore it with brown over the knee boots. one of my fave all time outfits right now.
3050	1	a	This is very cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. i'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok
3051	1	a	... runs large which is the opposite of what i see in the majority of others' reviews. since most reviews say it runs true to size i decided to purchased a size 28 which usually, it the perfect size for me no matter which brand, fabric, style, etc. it always fits... well, not in this case. i should have gotten a size 27. i felt very disappointed because these pants are beautiful. i got the 40% off sale at the time and now ca not exchange it since the price has changed and the product is unavail
3052	0	a	Listed on the package labeling but not in the product description. i am short in the waist and this is still much shorter than pictured. disappointed to send this one back as it otherwise perfect.
3053	1	a	Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.
3054	1	a	This dress has a really lovely design and is very, very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped, and does not have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still, it cute and i'm happy to have it!
3055	1	a	Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.
3056	0	a	Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.i found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t
3057	1	a	"This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2"" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips."
3058	1	a	I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them,. i exchanged for the next size up, because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store, i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.
3059	1	a	"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!"
3060	1	a	This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple, classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big, i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.
3061	1	a	I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top is not flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i did not give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir
3062	1	a	This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like, but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it on sale, however! then they're all mine!)this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it one o
3063	1	a	Love!!!! i was super hesitant to try this dress on, it did not look great online or on the hanger. but it looked great on! it has a very boho/70s/vintage feel. i am curvy, and it looked fabulous.
3064	1	a	This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just could not resist. it so flowy and comfortable. it quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it does not drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.
3065	1	a	I do a lot of online shopping and, consequently, a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant, nice and airy. when the shirt arrived, i almost thought that i should return it, because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in, you can see the blue specs woven in. i did not end up returning the shirt, because it extremely comfortable, and i still get a lot of complimen
3066	1	a	I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.
3067	1	a	The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
3068	1	a	This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.
3069	0	a	I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears, the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.
3070	1	a	"This is a beautiful dress, considering it is made from polyester. that being said, the material has a nice finish and looks like it could be silk. it a flattering cut (other than being a tad short-waisted) and hangs well. it was also a bit tight through the bust. unfortunately, if you are on the taller side, it tends to be high waisted and short in length.my daughter is 5'11"" and a size 10. the medium fit best, although because of the length, she is reluctantly returning it. sad, because it ha"
3071	1	a	A very versatile and cozy top. would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day. what a fun piece for my wardrobe!
3072	1	a	My new favorite dress. very flattering beautiful color, and great length. fabric feels very good as well. i'm usually s/m, purchased the medium and it fits perfectly
3073	0	a	I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today.
3074	1	a	"These are amazing! wide slits on out seam show off your cute shoes! runs large! i'm 5'7"", 140, size 6, hourglass. small was quite loose at waist. xs fits my actual waist and makes length right for flatter shoe <3"" heel. or small petite sits on my hips and makes length right for flatter shoe. both fit. there is ease through entire pant leg. beyond comfortable! does not wrinkle. looks great with the roll-neck sweater in ivory and a silver wedge shoe!"
3075	1	a	Very high quality dress. there are two layers (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight, making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.
3076	1	a	Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphen as a birthday gift for a family member, and she absolutely loved them! after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are, i had to get some for myself! i usually only wear denim pants, everything else is skirts, dresses or shorts. so this was a big change in style for me.so far i love them, they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great material!i'm 5' 2'' and 120lbs. they 27s fit perfectly. i do not have slim
3077	0	a	So despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways. the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect. the petite falls 30 from shoulder which means it right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show. it unfortunate because this dress is adorable. it would fit tts except length. unfortunately this one has to go back.
3078	1	a	In theory, this dress was perfect for me. the colors, the embroidery, the sheer top and keyhole back... so romantic! sigh. something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment. i'm usually 10-12, the 12 was way too big, the 10 more fitted, but still it was not quite right. the sheer part dips quite low, and sizing down helped, but it could still be a lil dangerous. i kept feeling like it was not defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt. maybe i would have fel
3079	1	a	Simple pull-on pant with a great design. they look flattering on and can easily be dressed up. i wear between a 4 and 6 and the small fit perfect. i have washed them and worn them several times and they still seem good as new. the wide elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place.
3080	0	a	I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress does not actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses.
3081	1	a	These pants look nice and they are comfortable too! the relaxed fit is not sloppy, and the colors are great.
3082	1	a	I love this piece, it fits well and is comfortable. you can dress it up or be more casual. i have received many compliments already and it goes with many of my outfits.
3083	1	a	This top is so fun, but more importantly, it is sooooo soft and comfortable!!
3084	1	a	The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality, then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit, i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!
3085	1	a	I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w
3086	1	a	The fit is incredible! the print is very subtle, but makes them a little bit edgy and easy to pair with many things i already have in my closet.
3087	1	a	I normally do not write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exception.i am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks. with a limited amount of time to plan, i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway, to arrive just before the actual ceremony. out of curiosity, i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall wedding-ish. they did! so i too
3088	1	a	I went into the store to look at a few certain items. this was not one of them but it really caught my eye. i got it in yellow. it is such a great sweater. tts
3089	0	a	I love, love, love byron lars dresses. they fit my curves like a glove. but this one... i guess it would have fit me like a glove. but i live alone, and at the moment i do not have enough money to hire a lady maid, and so i could not actually tell. it buttons all the way up the back, so you cannot put it on yourself, unless you are a contortionist. wanted to love this but ca not.
3090	1	a	"I really like this sweater. it is surprisingly warm. it is not very form fitting (which can slenderize), but i enjoy layering with a lacy tank and do not have to worry about sucking in the guy either ;). i'm 5' 8"" and typically wear between a 6-8, the medium was definitely baggy, i ended up with a small in 2 colors.!oh, and the bow detail really does add a fanciness to an otherwise comfy/snuggle sweater."
3091	1	a	I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture, loose and flowy.
3092	1	a	I have no need for this dress but had to have it. i read the reviews and when there was a sale weekend, pulled the trigger on it. just as reviewers noted, it very flattering. from the front. and, just as another reviewer noted, the back torso is widely misshapen, creating a hunchback look. but i figured a good tailor could make it right. it going to cost just under 2 jacksons to do it. which is about how much the discount was for the sale. but i expect to have this dress for years and ca not
3093	1	a	While the dress is pretty, it a lot more boring than it seems online. the box top is actually a completely separate piece, which is kind of neat - you can choose to remove it or not. the box top is very wide (much wider than on the model) and very unflattering! also, the dress is a stiff silk fabric and does not flow like you would think it would. returning it!
3094	1	a	I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this
3095	1	a	The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!
3096	0	a	Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!
3097	1	a	Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
3098	1	a	"I ordered these with high hopes. i have 2 other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore. i was disappointed. the fabric is not soft as i expected. the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band, but this might be due to folding while packaged. i tried these on several times - wanting to like them but just could not. i am returning them. the colors are beautiful - especially the bands on the bottom. they seem made well. it might just be that i am between sizes. i am 5'4"", 115. i tri"
3099	1	a	I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store, it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long, covering my hands, and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that are not related specifically to this sweater: even tho
3100	1	a	This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape, so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i ca not wait to wear this.
3101	1	a	This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!
3102	1	a	I tried on this top in the ivory color in the store, but i did not need another ivory-colored top, so i passed it up. however, i kept thinking about the pretty details, especially trim on the sleeves, so when i saw it online in the red color, i ordered it. i was surprised when it arrived with how thin and sheer the fabric is (the soft flowy mini-pleated body of the shirt; the other sections are flat cotton, which is more sturdy). i had not noticed this when i tried on the ivory version! but i'm ke
3103	1	a	I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i ca not really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.
3104	1	a	Dress is cute and comfortable to wear. i bought the black motif in regular size 0. it fits perfectly and falls just above my knees. i have washed it in the washing machine placed in a large zippered mesh bag and hung it to dry. as mentioned in previous reviews, with the exception of it being unlined, it a wonderful dress and am so happy to have it.
3105	0	a	"Again, nope. looks chic on the model, looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand, i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching did not do anything to flatter my figure, the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe"
3106	1	a	Ca not wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you do not need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of

3108	1	a	I wore this skirt immediately when my delivery arrived. nothing but compliments. i went right back to order the green and it has sold out. bummer - i would buy every. single. color. this skirt is that great!
3109	1	a	I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
3110	1	a	This is a great piece, which has flow, grace, and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time.
3111	1	a	"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs, athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great, just like glove, it does not make me look fat. the quality is great,sweater is warm, cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral, it a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
3112	1	a	This dress ran large on me. i am a 10, sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me, giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice, but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back, may try again if the next size makes it to sale.
3113	1	a	I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i'm 5'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay
3114	1	a	When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash, it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person, just fyi.
3115	0	a	Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
3116	0	a	This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it too delicate.
3117	1	a	"I really like this shirt but it a bit maternity. i do not mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here. i'm 5' 7"" about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret. since i'm done having kids, it has to go back. it also somewhat see through and had i kept it, i would have worn a tank top underneath.as long as these things do not bother you, it really is cute!"
3118	0	a	This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress was not tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? could not figure it out. the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.
3119	1	a	This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly does not feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.
3120	1	a	These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.
3121	1	a	Picked this up yesterday in the muted teal. great shape, great color. the pink one is way brighter in person and the green, i think, is more of a forest green. each one was a little different. super cute. good price.
3122	1	a	Even though this shirt is incredibly thin, i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup, with white jeans in the summer, over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!
3123	1	a	"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
3124	0	a	I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
3125	1	a	Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.
3126	1	a	This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back.
3127	0	a	I love every other byron lars dress i've bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m
3128	0	a	I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
3129	1	a	This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it so breezy but a tad matronly on me.
3130	0	a	I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece wedding. i usually wear a medium but could not get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it did not cut, but the top was huge. i really do not understand the sizing of this dress at all.
3131	1	a	I love, love, love this brand. these people know how to cut and construct a dress. i'm apple-shaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me, but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws. the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great. the fabric is high-quality and fully-lined. it perfect for work or for going out. i love that it black and bronze-y, because i can wear it with black or brown accessories. i'm generally between a l/xl in retailer and the l fits wel
3132	1	a	I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i do not even need to wear a bra with it
3133	0	a	I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me. too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section. going back.
3134	1	a	My daughter loves these, she wears them around the house all day when she does not have to go out.
3135	1	a	Got this shirt in the map design - super cute! it looks great with jeans or chinos in different colors. fun and different shirt. fit just as expected.
3136	1	a	The fair-isle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick, but not itchy. the neckline is a perfect crew cut style- not too tight, but compliments the neck itself. the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans, blue or gray cords, etc. so many options!!!
3137	1	a	"I do not usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it."
3138	1	a	I love this!! great quality and super cozy. perfect to throw on for casual summer nights.
3139	1	a	"I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8"", athletic build and a normal medium, this runs large. i bough smalls."
3140	1	a	Loved this online and it did not disappoint. lightweight and super flattering. fabric is sheer with a lovely windowpane pattern. top front of the bodice is lined. looks great with a pair of jeans. super easy to care for. toss in washer in a mesh bag and it comes our perfectly. will likely be a go-to summer piece.
3141	0	a	"Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or is not she"" kind of way."
3142	1	a	"So i tried this on in the store and ended up with the size 8 (almost could have gone with a size 6) even though i'm 135lbs 5'6"" and 34 c. the dress is beautiful! the color is exactly as pictured - brilliant red. the linen is nice and summery. it does make it billow just a tad in the back because of the fabric but not anything to complain about. if i could change just one thing on this dress it would be the length. it just feels a little short for being such a classic and classy dress; just needs"
3143	1	a	Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.
3144	1	a	Precious tee, washes well, runs large
3145	1	a	Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans, shorts, crops...some say it a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger, i would not call it boxy and i definitely did not find it to run short. a great staple, wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.
3146	1	a	I love this jumper! it is absolutely gorgeous and also quite possibly the most comfortable piece of clothing i've ever owned.
3147	0	a	Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back.
3148	1	a	This tank top is comfortable and very cute. it hides my tummy, as well, which is a bonus! ordered in another color i love it so much
3149	1	a	"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said."
3150	1	a	I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :)
3151	1	a	Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i do not think it will be available for too long.
3152	1	a	"I am so glad i returned this dress for a size down. i am 5'10"", and 160 lbs (curvy and muscular build), and the medium was surprisingly much too large on me. i returned it for a small, and oh my, it is perfect. i plan on wearing this to two summer weddings this year, and will then wear it for work. it really is a go-anywhere-do-anything sort of dress."
3153	1	a	"I must disagree with some of the other reviews! when i first saw this dress online, i loved it and could not wait to try it on. i did not order it online because i read some of the other reviews and so i wanted to try it on in the store before i bought it because i was nervous the fit was not going to be good. they were so wrong! maybe it just takes a certain body type. i have an hourglass figure, and i'm 5'8"" tall, i tried on a size 10, and it fit beautifully! the waist is very form fitting, and t"
3154	1	a	Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch. fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!
3155	0	a	The material is awesome and it a super pretty dress it just did not work on my body.
3156	1	a	I love this tunic! it wool but the same kind of thin high quality wool you might find in a nicer scarf. colors are much nicer than they show up online. this is one you really need to see in person. the only drawback is that the material seems to snag easily. i returned the top at full price as it is just too much to spend for something i'll only wear a few times before no doubt ruining it. if you are not hard on your clothes like i am, this is a great find. i may repurchase it when/if it gets
3157	0	a	I loved this coat in the picture, and could not wait to get it. sadly, it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small, and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves, and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape, and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs, but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable, and honestly i ca not believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
3158	1	a	This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!
3159	1	a	I took a chance on this in green, extra small (one size smaller than my normal size) because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater. no, it too awesome to waste as a liner. it the most amazing cut and fabric. it so flattering and so soft.please bring back this top!!!!
3160	1	a	"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank."
3161	1	a	This shirt is amazing. it soft, comfortable. i ca not speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture, color, and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.the col
3162	1	a	I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they did not have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.
3163	0	a	I ordered this in a l online, and was not a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright, but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit, because of the material there is no give at all, it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short, and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.
3164	1	a	I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.
3165	1	a	This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.
3166	1	a	This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'2 about 105 pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you wo not
3167	1	a	I thought this was a fun piece to have, but did not realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes, or dressing it up with fancier accessories.i love this jumpsuit!it is well made, and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy
3168	1	a	This turtleneck is already wrapped and it soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.)
3169	1	a	"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked."
3170	1	a	As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it! i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders. i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress. i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee. it the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!
3171	0	a	Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.
3172	1	a	I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just ca not do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.
3173	1	a	I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it stretchy. i'm a 36d and it hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!
3174	1	a	I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :)
3175	1	a	This romper is really cute. it flowy and wide at the middle, which i like. it comfortable. i ordered my usual size small and it was too big. i'm hoping an exchange will do the trick .
3176	1	a	"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70. it very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this."
3177	1	a	Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!
3178	1	a	I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.
3179	1	a	Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy, does not need to be ironed really, substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i'm rarely a 2 at retailer, but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i'm usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this.
3180	1	a	I actually love this dress. the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing. the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look. my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering. i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more. i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does, so i sized up. all this did was make me look wider, especially at the shoulders. the drawstring at the elastic makes
3181	1	a	This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly, easy to wear and comfy, too! highly recommend!
3182	1	a	"I'm loving these, even if they are a wee bit tight. i'm 5'6"" 130 lbs and they hit well above my ankle, as in the photo. ordered a 29 (i vacillate between a 28 and 29) and am finding a little muffin top spillage even after wearing a couple of times. the good news? these babies stay pretty well exactly as they come - as opposed to stretching out a ton. the denim is durable and stretchy and i would totally recommend them."
3183	1	a	This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.
3184	0	a	I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears.
3185	1	a	"I bought this for an event, and when it arrived, i realized it was probably too dressy for my event. there are some large sparkly clusters of ""stones"" that are beautiful, but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed. if i had something to wear it to, i would keep it in a heartbeat. the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces. there are cups already in the bodice, which is a huge plus imo. it unique and beautiful!"
3186	1	a	"This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1"", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28"" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it 26.25"" long, but it actually just about 24"". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)"
3187	0	a	I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
3188	1	a	My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the 'faux-fur cardi' in the ivory to wear over this top. it a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you
3189	1	a	I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.
3190	1	a	"The reason i purchased these pants is because i do not have anything like it. they are fun but nice enough to wear in the work place. well constructed, too. the only thing is they are very long. i am 5'4"" and these are probably 3-4 inches below what the picture shows. i had purchased a pair of platform shoes from retailer awhile back that will go perfect with these pants; however, i my still have to have them hemmed. other than that, they run pretty true to size. i usually wear a size 10 and the pa"
3191	1	a	Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it does not cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d
3192	1	a	"I am 5'3"" 28/38 and i ordered the regular s. if i left it the way it came, it would have been low-waisted and too long, so i am having the waist taken in a couple of inches so it is now high waisted and the length is fine with heels. i did not opt to exchange for a smaller size as the derriere fit fine. it anyway does not define your shape much in the rear. agree that fabric is lighter than expected, but the color and drape are nice. it has stitched-in shorts that fall above the knee. i think wi"
3193	1	a	Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!
3194	1	a	I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it was not part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i do not know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
3195	1	a	This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.
3196	1	a	"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!"
3197	1	a	I loved the fabric, cut and style of these shirts, the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully. please make again maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic, a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker. sill i love this top
3198	1	a	Dolan is my go to for comfy, pretty, practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color, but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
3199	1	a	I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!
3200	1	a	Love this top.!!! this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans. please make it in more colors. i think it should be less expensive.
3201	1	a	"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it does not feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai"
3202	1	a	I had the priviledge of trying this on during the 20% off tops sale, too bad but the store only had regualr sizes, and xs was the smallest. i am not super tiny (read have muscles), but this looked huge on me. love the colros and textures though, the line in the back is pretty and adds charm when you turn around, and the combo of all the colros is awesome, but i would need a xxs or perhaps a petite (though it is short, so not sure about petite)... soft, but try a smaller size...
3203	1	a	"I have always been a pilcro fan and these are so comfortable and fit well in the legs. i'm 5'6"" and 128 and the size 26 fit very well."
3204	1	a	I?ve been looking at this dress online for some time now, but i?ve been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat. it just did not seem right. but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it. it is a wonderfully soft, linen dress. it is a bit tight in the midriff, so i had to size up a bit. i usually wear a size 2, but went with size 4 this time. size 4 fit perfectly. it is comfortable, easy to wear, just the right amount of sexy. it will be a nice every day dress for summer i
3205	1	a	I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.
3206	0	a	After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo
3207	1	a	I absolutely love this shirt. it so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!
3208	1	a	This is the perfect casual top to wear alone or layered with a cardigan. love it!
3209	1	a	"I saw this online, visited my local retailer, found it! it is the most beautiful shade of blue, nicely textured material! i am 5'7"" and 148 pds, i bought the xs and it fits perfect! definately designed for us smaller busted gals!"
3210	1	a	I bought these on a whim on mother day when i was out shopping. i did not try even try them on at the store. i got them home and could not believe how great they fit and how comfortable they were. the length is perfect for me. not too long or too short. they did stretch out a bit upon wearing them but i like the comfortable, relaxed look. i washed and dried them in the dryer. they came out perfect. i bought the coral color. will be buying more as it is hard to find shorts that work for me. i rec
3211	1	a	I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.
3212	1	a	I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it fairly warm, too.
3213	1	a	These are the best leggings i've ever worn. because they are structured and substantial, they are less casual than ordinary leggings. i bought them for a trip to paris, and i wore them many times. they're sleek, stylish, comfortable, and they go with everything!
3214	0	a	I love this sweater, so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color, it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party. i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
3215	1	a	Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top, i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.
3216	1	a	Had to have this dress as soon as i saw it in store. i am heavy chested (40dd). bought it in an xl. it is so colorful and vibrant. dress would look good on any skin tone. love that it is a shift dress. perfect with sandals or wedges.
3217	0	a	I liked the look of the tunic sweater, and it was very soft. i am 5'7, 115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight, but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings, and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft, but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
3218	1	a	"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i was not sure how they would fit, but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up, boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique, unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this"
3219	1	a	I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
3220	1	a	I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on, but when i brought it home, i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!
3221	0	a	I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants were not tight at all, but the seams wre not strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.
3222	0	a	Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material, now, the wash is not as real, almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why, pilcro?? the sizing is about the same, they run a little large due to the
3223	1	a	This cardigan is just the right length, i.e. not too long as so many are these days. but the sleeves are ridiculously long. will have to shorten them for sure. fabric is definitely not heavy. pretty color. i do like it overall..
3224	1	a	Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent
3225	1	a	This dress fits so perfectly. just the right amount of skin, not too bare, not too short, not too long. ca not wait to wear it. great quality.
3226	0	a	I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. second, the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been
3227	1	a	Super soft fabric! the opening in the back makes it very chic.
3228	1	a	I saw this in the store and immediately loved it even before trying on. the style is classic and the fit is perfect. the material is soft and comfortable. it hugs without clinging. i tried on the black in s and the green in xs and went with the green. different shoes and accessories will dress this up or down. i plan to travel with it several times this summer. it will be a great option to wear on the plane and arrive looking chic.
3229	0	a	Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you ca not see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i do not like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
3230	1	a	This swing tee is amazing! i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online. the material is so soft and cozy. i am typically an xs and bought an xs, however it runs ever so slightly big. if i had purchased the xxs, it seems like the arms would have been to tight and i'm definitely not a fan of that. whatever the case, i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long.
3231	1	a	Great everyday dress. i bought a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it really fits nicely.
3232	1	a	This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline did not appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.
3233	1	a	This shirt is true to size. it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable. it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner.
3234	1	a	This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years. the fact that it machine washable was a huge plus. fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect! i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room, but either would have fit well.
3235	1	a	Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!
3236	1	a	"Love! i am 5'3"" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase"
3237	1	a	If you have muscular thighs, like me, these wo not fit well. i'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed, i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part. had to return for not fitting well. but the quality of the product was nice.
3238	1	a	It maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!
3239	1	a	I love the weight and drape of this vest; it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts. i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall. however, it runs a week bit small across the bust. i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit. sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out.
3240	1	a	I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i do not like polyester; still, i could not pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i
3241	1	a	I'm being eyeballing this dress for quite a while, finally i decided to jump on it and i was so ansy to receive it in the mail, finally arrived and some how was not what i was expecting, the front part has 2 pieces of fabric attached to the sides of the dress that wrap around your waist making that effect you see on the model. to be honest i did not like that at all, i think they ruined the dress with that, the dress is very comfortable feeling, the fabric is super soft i can imagine wearing this
3242	1	a	"I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the ""coats"" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5'6"" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open, the coat looked great but when i trie"
3243	1	a	"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it very comfortable as well. unfortunately, it got ocean water on it in my photos, so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6"" and wore sandals and"
3244	1	a	Love, love, love this dress! the fabric is high quality; the colors are rich and vibrant. the fit is very flattering, with the open neckline and fitted waist. versatile piece that can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or dressed down with tights and boots. my usual size fits perfectly.
3245	0	a	True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
3246	1	a	I was so happy to find this in extra small. it is such a cute loose fitting top.. very soft and flowy tank. the orange color is so pretty. i went down a size in this top
3247	1	a	This dress is made with stretchy cottony fabric, yet, very forgiving. it fits like a glove but does not show bulges. fit is perfect, i had originally purchased the white and grey, but the petite length is better. too bad as i do love me some red. oh well.
3248	1	a	Like the other reviewers experienced, i received my top in the mail, and it does not have the straps as shown in the online pictures. not to say that the top is not attractive, though, and i'll be keeping it. very comfortable and cool in the triple-digit heat in my community.
3249	1	a	I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up. i wear a 26 or 27 and i took the large. the large is not tight at all but the medium was. i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and do not mind them a little big. i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute.
3250	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i tried it because of the detail but did not hold out much hope because it looked frumpy on the hanger. i was very wrong. it fits beautifully. it drapes nicely, hugs the shoulders perfectly and does not droop open due to the embellishments. there is a tiny closure where the fabric crosses in the front so you are not exposed. i liked that feature very much. the sleeves are 3/4 on me, but i like it - nice change of pace. this is a very different style
3251	1	a	This dress is gorgeous and has beautiful lines. it is a little on the big side, but the fabric drapes enough that it does not matter.
3252	1	a	I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!
3253	0	a	I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i did not like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.
3254	1	a	Soft and romantic. i love it! just like pictured and i wear a cami under. dress up or down
3255	1	a	On the real...i needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room! what yes i'd love some more pumpkin pie. know what im saying?! what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model, made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me. please please just swing and not cling. mmmmm...k. the majority (70%) of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online. so glad i did!
3256	1	a	"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i did not notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'"
3257	1	a	Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.
3258	0	a	I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets, thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable, i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.
3259	1	a	I feel like this top is almost perfect, but there something missing. the details are nice, the fit is fine, but something was not right. maybe it was the weird arm length?fits tts, if a tad on the large side.
3260	1	a	This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and does not go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i did not see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer
3261	0	a	Super itchy! had to return.
3262	0	a	The skirt has a great cute design and great colors and great shape. but it runs very small and short. this company needs to provide a better fit, and large sizes if they run small.
3263	1	a	"I was on the fence about this dress - i wanted something nice but casual for a family graduation. i'm glad i took the chance once it went on sale! the fabric is not as thick as you'd expect for a ""sweater."" just thick enough to hide any imperfections, panty lines, etc. i plan to layer with long sleeved tees or a jean jacket. i think it will do great through fall with tights and a turtleneck.i'm 5'6', 135 lbs, 34b and the small fit perfectly. i am ""pear - shaped"" by conventional standards, bu"
3264	1	a	Very comfortable dress for fall and early winter. love the material and great to throw on to run errands in over the weekend, or could dress up with flats and sweater for work.
3265	1	a	I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing.
3266	1	a	I was not expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i did not like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...ca not wait!
3267	1	a	I wore this dress to a party once and have not been able to find an outfit that can top it!
3268	1	a	Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right. it definitely loose fitting, but it really cute and well made. i usually get a medium size in tops/sweaters but, after reading the other reviews, i ordered the small and i'm so glad i did - it the perfect casual cardigan. i wish it came in more colors!
3269	1	a	Not as pink as pictured online, definitely more of a pale peach. fits loose, so i'm glad i went with my normal size, or would seem boxy. cute top, and will wear it around town running errands..instead of my activewear!
3270	1	a	"I love this tee, and am a picky tee person. it runs big, the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am 115 lbs and 5'2"". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not 5 stars due to stretched out arm holes."
3271	0	a	This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i
3272	1	a	The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans do not show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v
3273	0	a	Really like this dress but.....the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dressworst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.impossible!has to go back
3274	1	a	"Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3"", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s."
3275	1	a	I love love love this dress..it a quality well fitting jean dress..that you can dress up or down..the top portion dies run small..so of you are busy you might want to stay away from this dress..
3276	1	a	Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color. great tank. it is not thin like some other retailer tops. it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we do not want anyone to see or worry about. the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.it is extremely comfortable a
3277	1	a	I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!
3278	1	a	Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i do not have an occasion to wear this).length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.color is very nice, overall sexy dress.material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)
3279	1	a	The dress does run large. i'm 5'4 and 135 and the xs fit great. it a very comfortable summer dress. have had many compliments on it.
3280	1	a	I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also, the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!
3281	1	a	So cheerful and colorful! love these cozy pj pants!
3282	1	a	I bough this top in blue and i really like the color , style and fabric. i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together. it a departure from more tailored clothing for me. i keep on trying linen tops and up to now, this seems the best cut for linen. as the fabric stretches, it will still fall nicely.
3283	0	a	Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it was not easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
3284	1	a	"I love this dress in the photos, and like it enough to keep it--but i do not love it. it runs borderline true-to-size/slightly large. i'm 5'8"", 133 lbs, 34 b and usually wear a 6 in dresses. i ordered a sm and med. am keeping the sm. medium was way too big. my main issue is the amount of fabric in the skirt--it a bit full. in the pics, this dress appears straight, but it not. the higher waist and skirt fullness gives it a more casual, youthful look, which is not what i want. but the quality"
3285	1	a	I really loved the dress in the picture. it is reallynice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming itwould have ruined the details of the dress. they werebackordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it.
3286	1	a	Cute top, great for the inner maid marian fan. :) fun twist on t-shirt in regular size. also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein, but did not care for that one at all. this one was cute and the fit is flattering. the other is boxy and boring to me. recommend this one.
3287	0	a	I purchased this dress online and it just did not fit my body very well. it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i ca not say that i'm impressed with the quality. there were other areas too where was a loose thread which i'm sure will develop into another hole eventually. returned.
3288	1	a	I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath (because of the lace detailing on the back). however, this shirt is a bit see-through, so i still had to wear a tank with it. it very cute even with the tank though!
3289	1	a	Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.
3290	0	a	Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress
3291	1	a	I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone wardrobe.
3292	1	a	So cute! i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it. very comfortable. i ordered a petite l and it a little big. i usually buy the petite m, but due to the under slip i was not sure.
3293	1	a	Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. it a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, it flattering for us curvier ladies,
3294	0	a	This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
3295	1	a	"I love this jacket. it has great structure and lays nicely, while still have knit arms and a lining. do not try this on if you are not prepared to buy it because it amazing. color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly. definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons."
3296	1	a	This is a quirky, whimsical, uniquely designed top that sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is, a fun, conversation piece. and is not that what great about fashion? tts, very comfy, yes boxy, but i do not think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties, or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.
3297	1	a	I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.
3298	1	a	Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron ca not fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.
3299	0	a	"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable, it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9"", 145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just ca not keep it."
3300	0	a	I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however, two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
3301	0	a	"I'm 5' 5"", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast."
3302	1	a	As stated in my review title, they're amazing! they're incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 5'3 is not surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i could not recommend these enough
3303	0	a	I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just did not do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
3304	1	a	"Wish this site had ""ask a question about the product"" feature like amazon does. just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color? it looks orange but descriptor says red. would appreciate feedback. thank you for your help."
3305	1	a	I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height!
3306	1	a	I'm taking this to hawaii for the holidays, i'm wearing it with black calf length tights and a black belt. it is fine without tights, i just like that look. it is a really great dress.
3307	0	a	The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
3308	0	a	On me, this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9, 34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly, for the price and fit, i would not consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.
3309	1	a	These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.
3310	1	a	This dress is flattering in so many ways. fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips. sizing is perfect. i also bought it in the navy/black color. you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops.
3311	1	a	This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
3312	1	a	"This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p"" on it. it not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large."
3313	1	a	This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal
3314	0	a	I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts do not fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
3315	0	a	The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
3316	1	a	I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.
3317	1	a	Love this dress...light and comfortable and fits true to size. i have larger shoulders and the halter design is really flattering. you can dress up or dress down which is a huge plus for me!
3318	1	a	This is a great shirt. the ruffles are strategically placed and hide any stomach flaws. i get that others are surprised by the arm slits but a couple of well placed stitches will make it very work appropriate or if you're worried about arm waggle. the color borders on black/navy
3319	1	a	I love these jeans! they are super soft and just the right weight for year around. however, they do run large. i normally wear a size 27. i am 5'7 and weigh 127#. because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue, i ordered a size down=26. they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange. these are perfect. i get tons of compliments when i wear them...i would love to see coh make them in a true black.
3320	1	a	This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i had not seen it in store, i do not think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i'm glad i tried a second on, because i th
3321	1	a	This cardigan is lovely, casual layering piece. it a very thin lightweight knit and pairs well with a tee or tank under it. i really like the color and the style. the longer front can drape or tie for multiple looks
3322	1	a	"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser did not look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5'1.5"". (115 lbs, 03 dd che"
3323	1	a	I highly recommend this dress! it is super flattering and i got so many compliments. it fits like a glove and honestly made me look 10 lbs thinner. very romantic and has great movement. the length is perfect, since the top is quite modest, it nice that it on the shorter side - makes it a little flirty! i was not sure of the pattern at first, but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway. by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern. it really stood out and i can'
3324	1	a	Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it beyond a-line, it a tent. i'm keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if
3325	0	a	These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.
3326	1	a	"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great"
3327	1	a	I ordered this top in all 3 colors, love the peplum.look..returned the green, which is actually my fav color but it was not a pretty shade of green and i do not think that it was a flattering contrast with the cream,, especially going into spring/summer..kept the yellow and the navy and love..the navy is classic and the yellow is soft and flattering.it a very cute top, runs a little large, but is very pretty.
3328	1	a	I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description did not give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need
3329	1	a	This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.
3330	0	a	Definitely cute and good fit but the distressing at knee is open and will probably get worse, worth it if price lower... maybe
3331	0	a	Based on the photos, i thought this dress would be very flattering on an hourglass shape. i ordered the faded reddish pink color. the color was true to the photo and very pretty and soft. the dress has an open neckline, fitted waist and skirt length that are all flattering, but the fabric is thin and clingy, making the dress overall not flattering on anyone not as thin as the model. it certainly does not hang. i believe it runs true to size. i'm generally a xs/s and i ordered a s and the fit was
3332	1	a	This top is adorable; fits like a glove which makes me a little nervous...there were no washing instructions attached so i will hope for the best. the quality of your garments are always excellent; its only the risk of buying on line (sizing) which makes me hold my breath until i can try my order on. it is a joy to get items that fit from retailer, my favorite online store!
3333	1	a	This dress is even better in person! the attention to detail and craftsmanship are amazing. i received compliments all night from total strangers.
3334	1	a	Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.
3335	1	a	Love these! so comfortable, feels like wearing pajama leggings! they're stretchy but do not lose their shape, and the fabric is super soft!
3336	1	a	Love, love this top. it is soft, comfortable, and cute. it is versatile (e.g. i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans). the tie at the neck adds a cute detail (if you want it tied). great staple for the wardrobe. i purchased in the black and it is very versatile, not sure how i feel about the print...
3337	1	a	"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! ca not wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!"
3338	1	a	I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it really not that sheer so you do not need to. it a lovely piece
3339	0	a	The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves, i would buy in a minute. we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining. now the cons, i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look. it runs short and i ca not imagine who thought this design was a good idea. there were no reviews when i ordered. i am learning to try it on in the store and/or read the reviews before investing. i would say go up a
3340	1	a	I love this dress, the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled! once i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!!
3341	1	a	As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...
3342	0	a	I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but did not complement my average one.
3343	1	a	"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about"
3344	1	a	I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it a relaxed fit so it not super fitted and it loose around the waist which is great. it a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!
3345	1	a	I would say that this blouse runs 1-2 sizes too small. the fabric is unique - it like gauze backed by fine netting - and the workmanship is excellent.
3346	1	a	The fit of these jeans are so great! they look syllish and feel great at the same time. this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual. a+
3347	0	a	This is a very cute and warm dress. it is flattering, yet appropriate for work. but i had to send it back for two reasons. the zipper did not work well. it just would not zip without someone helping me and even then it was very difficult to zip. perhaps it was just the zipper on my dress?the neck felt like it was strangling me was the other reason i sent it back. if i am not comfortable i will not end up wearing it, so even though i loved the style of it the pragmatics were lacking.
3348	0	a	Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.
3349	1	a	I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small, i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length, short but not too short.
3350	1	a	I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!
3351	1	a	This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!
3352	1	a	This is my new favorite dress!
3353	0	a	I love cashmere, love the length, cowl-neck and colors, however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person, which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
3354	1	a	As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!
3355	1	a	"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65"", 135 and the small is perfect."
3356	1	a	Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely.
3357	1	a	This top is very cute. the fit is great and the material is very comfortable. i am a 5'7, 135 lbs and wear a 36d and the medium fit great!
3358	1	a	I ordered the blouse in black. it not quite black but maybe in between a brownish gray. very pretty color. it fits just right. would have like it just a tad longer.
3359	1	a	If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting.
3360	1	a	Great feature...perfect lacing...do not need to worry that it is too low since there is material behind the bottom of the lacing. like 3/4 length sleeve. gives top the right proportion.
3361	1	a	I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!
3362	0	a	Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.
3363	1	a	"I'm 4 11"" 120 and my usual small fit. as with everything....way too long. story of my life and i keel a tailor on call."
3364	1	a	Love the dress, a little cheaply made but overall, it fits nice and will be great next fall. it will show tummy shape so if you do not have a flat tummy, this may not be the dress for you.
3365	1	a	This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.
3366	0	a	This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small, ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters, but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.
3367	1	a	This is a modern version of the peplum top and very flattering if you do not mind flowy cuts. the material has a nice heaviness to it, and i love the black pebbled effect. 34 d, 130 lbs fit small perfectly.
3368	0	a	I love this shirt, in fact, i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry, it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this, but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.
3369	0	a	This design looks really sharp on the image, but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi. the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap. since the fabric was pretty soft, with a gray jersey lining, it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer. i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b, i felt like i was busting out of a size 8, and i am a 34d.
3370	1	a	This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i do not have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress.
3371	1	a	The fabric at the trim and shoulders is crepe, which is not clear from the photo. much nicer in person than online. runs large. i wear a large in knit tops (36d and to hide a soft belly) but this large was too big. armholes showed my bra and it was rather wide and boxy. i'll exchange for a m because i think i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer. a casual tank with a little spunk. cute!
3372	0	a	It not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.
3373	1	a	These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small, my normal size, was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly.
3374	1	a	I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir
3375	0	a	I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
3376	1	a	This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
3377	1	a	"I knew i had to have this shirt when i saw it online. the embroidery is almost like english smocking. i was not disappointed when i opened my package. the only flaw i've noticed is that it does ""pucker"" slightly around the shoulders and chest area due to the tight embroidery not allowing it to stretch. it is not terribly noticeable though. lovely shirt all around."
3378	1	a	Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments
3379	1	a	The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type. i normally wear 12/14 and 12 fit great (if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size) spillage is possible with wrong size lol.
3380	0	a	This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.
3381	1	a	Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy, and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side, but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small.
3382	0	a	I had high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it so odd.
3383	1	a	This is a great, effortless top. you can dress it up or down and fits true to size. it forgiving and the straps draw your eye to the most flattering part of the body. the fabric is stretchy and and comfortable.
3384	1	a	I am normally a size m, sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs, but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(
3385	0	a	Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i could not get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and ca not see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip.
3386	1	a	Quality fabric, nice fit and style. it not sheer, which is ideal for such a lightweight tank for summer. i like the flowiness of the top, makes it comfortable, and super cute with fitted jeans
3387	0	a	Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
3388	1	a	Super soft, cozy cardigan! i have a long torso and this is just the right length to cover my behind! i wish retailer would carry more sweaters with this shape. the sweater is soft and light - perfect for every day and you could wear it year round, although with its lighter weight, it might not be as perfect for winter. i purchased this in the kelly green color and it gorgeous. i have it on right now!
3389	1	a	This sweater is a hit. the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch. looks amazing paired with booties, a statement necklace and jeans. definitely affordable too! highly recommend
3390	1	a	I like the natural fiber of this dress- both the lining and outer layer are comfortable, breathable cotton. the dress has a casual contemporary vibe with the plaid weave and asymmetrical hem, but is surprisingly fitted in some areas. the bust of the xsp was too tight for me, and as a 34 b i do not usually have the problem of being too busty for my clothes. i normally wear an xsp in a dress that seems loose and flowy like this one, but this dress is more fitted than you might suspect from the webs
3391	1	a	I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.
3392	1	a	I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.
3393	1	a	When i first tried on this romper, i grabbed a 6 (my normal size) but because of my bust size, i could not even get the top half to cover me at all. i decided to give this romper another go a month later, and tried on the 8...it made all the difference! i love it, it fits amazing, and it is just too cool.
3394	0	a	This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it pretty bad when it wo not even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!
3395	1	a	Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors, they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!
3396	1	a	This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!
3397	0	a	I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i could not even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color, it really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.
3398	0	a	I carry my weight on my lower half, usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it does not have a waste band. returned.
3399	1	a	This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy.
3400	1	a	Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers, it itchy, but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s, my usual size.
3401	1	a	I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.
3402	1	a	This fabric and quality of the skirt are superb- there is a pretty metallic thread detail in the fabric that is not easy to see online. however, the skirt is quite puffy, which i suppose could be good for someone with a boyish figure looking to add curves. but for many of us the extra puff might not be welcome. one would want to wear it with a tight fitting top and emphasize a small waist in order to counterbalance the volume of the skirt. could be a nice buy for the right person, just be aware o
3403	1	a	Like other reviewers, i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips.
3404	1	a	This swimsuit is beautiful. the quality is excellent. controls without being too thick. the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous. i am curvy , 34dd and the top fit perfect. good bottom coverage. very happy with this purchase.
3405	1	a	I love these, but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt, but they are still too long. too cute to return though.
3406	1	a	Great basic tank with a bit of a 'flair' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white.
3407	1	a	I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab
3408	1	a	Did not notice the zipper in the back when i ordered this so it was a nice surprise
3409	0	a	This one did not work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam did not hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it was not much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
3410	1	a	This dress is unique and lovely! it is a one of a kind dress. i found it to be true to size. the only downside is the quality of the buttons.
3411	0	a	I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just does not work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i ca not
3412	1	a	Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.
3413	1	a	"I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print.based on the existing reviews, i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer, but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b."
3414	1	a	I really like this dress! i was not sure what to expect when i ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits well and it very cute and different.
3415	1	a	I love the fabric of this shirt -- it super soft. however the fit is off -- i'm normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i'm a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i'm going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...)
3416	1	a	Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit. i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, should not fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
3417	1	a	This shirt is so pretty and casual however with a nice scarf, it can also be worn to a nicer restaurant. it also hides all my flaws. the only concern i have is, it a bit thin material and not sure how long it will last. having said that, i love how the material looks and falls on my body. i love it so much i bought a white shirt as well as the lavender.
3418	0	a	The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.i would not even buy this at the sale price.
3419	0	a	This runs way big, i'm a size 8, purchased the medium. it just big with no shape.
3420	1	a	Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.
3421	1	a	I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i ca not say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore
3422	1	a	I'm obsessed with this skirt and was so excited when it came in the mail. i ordered a m, and it was massive! i'm 5'9 and typically wear a 6 or an 8. as i do not really have much of a waist/am built more like a column, i wanted it to sit right at my waist/right under my ribs. wanted to wear a crop top with it, but it fell down to my hips which made me look significantly larger. the quality is amazing, and the skirt is even better looking in person! worth ordering in a size down and getting it tail
3423	1	a	"I am in love with this dress. it super soft, flattering and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one."
3424	1	a	This looks awesome with leggings / jeggings and booties or slip ons. great buy. its a wee big, but there are slits up the sides pretty high.
3425	0	a	The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i would not recommend for anything but waking.
3426	1	a	I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they do not slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.
3427	0	a	"I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same, not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted, generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom, peplum""ish"" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
3428	0	a	I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
3429	1	a	"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)i am around 5'6"" and a little on the broad side, so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari"
3430	1	a	I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size did not pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and did not look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.
3431	1	a	If you care that it sheer- be forewarned. i probably wo not wear a cami under it, as it not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.
3432	1	a	Love these pants- they are so soft and comfortable- do not fall down like low rise trousers. i like the length for wearing with flats - most wide bottom pants are too long, and these are very casual to be worn with flats.
3433	1	a	I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price. i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made. the material is a lightwei
3434	1	a	I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 105 lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks are not the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it cotton, mad
3435	1	a	Very soft for vegan leather. very stylish. i thought it ran slightly small for size indicated on jacket. daughter is 8-10 but medium was tight.
3436	1	a	This skirt is a perfect statement piece that will work fancy cocktails and social events. it is a full skirt but not too overwhelming. perfect with a slim fitting black bodysuit. i sized up a bit and ordered an 8. waist fits well and length works with slight heel. quality is great. design is beautiful without being too much.
3437	1	a	This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it just a very good design. note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).
3438	1	a	Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.
3439	0	a	I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you do not mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
3440	1	a	I bought this to wear to my winter bridal shower. it was a cold day so i turned it into a jumper by pairing it with a silk blouse. it is flattering and comfortable. great for work and other semi-formal events.
3441	1	a	These are so comfy! mom of two boys on the go! great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town! not mom jeans!
3442	1	a	Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially
3443	1	a	This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother one-piece.
3444	1	a	I like this top. it fits nicely. the knit is thicker than i though it would be t but i still like it.
3445	0	a	This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all.
3446	1	a	I spend most of my time searching for the perfect pair of jeans (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but only slight). finally, the the ag stevie are it. this is my third pair. now, for more colors...
3447	1	a	I was looking for cute comfy stylish tees and was ecstatic when i came across this one. i purchased the coral and i love it! it adorable on, i'm going to purchase another color. so happy!
3448	1	a	This vest is a great fall item. the asymmetrical design and unusual buttons really give it interest even though it is black. you could wear it open or closed, both look cute. appears to be high quality.
3449	1	a	I was looking for something business casual when i ran into this dress in store. i was able to wear a petite small, but am normally a 4-6 in dresses. it does run large! its perfect with heels for work or dressed down with boots in the fall. it is very comfortable and still looks like you're trying.
3450	1	a	I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material, to the design, and fit, i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique, and i love, love, love the pockets, which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering, as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w
3451	1	a	I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size 4 fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color. would definitely recommend.
3452	1	a	I loved the design of this suit when i saw it online.the material is definitely high quality and the bottoms i knew would stay put, if they had fit me in the first place. i ordered a size medium in both top and bottom. the bottoms were much much too small and the top was just ever so slightly too large. i should've known something was up with sizing because all of the larges were sold out already. i think i could've used a large bottom and a size small top.
3453	0	a	I really liked the casual style of this top, but i was disappointed when i put it on. it cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just do not seem to hang right. they do not hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured, more like 3/4 which i did not like. the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off. i tried xs and s. both fit weird.
3454	0	a	This is a pretty red dress. the back is beautiful. i ordered it online and was excited when it arrived. however, as soon as i took it out of the package, i saw that it had a snag on the front bodice. i also did not realize the dress material was not as heavy as i was hoping for it to be. given those two details, i decided to return it. maybe if it had arrived in perfect condition, i would have kept it. *sigh*
3455	1	a	I love the fabric and design of this dress. you will definitely get noticed. and it comfortable - just slip it on and go!
3456	1	a	Extreme comfort for travel and out door activities.
3457	1	a	I thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit. after trying it on in a store (must have been a return), i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small. the straps were a little hard to manage. it is cute and i think cuter than on the model.
3458	1	a	I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style, fit, and fabric. an eternal fan of ag, i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up, dressed them down, and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.
3459	1	a	"I am 5'3"", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors."
3460	1	a	Great transitional top. comfy and great fit. i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small. i usually buy medium.
3461	1	a	I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.
3462	1	a	Very comfortable nightgown, love that it had pockets. fit is as expected.
3463	0	a	"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"
3464	1	a	I love this jacket. something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights, and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot. i am 5'3' and have a medium frame but 34 dd on top. i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest, and this is perfect. my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets. i got the wine color and it is very beautiful. wonderful, unique and comfortable jacket. i do recommend it.
3465	1	a	I bought each color in three different sizes because the one i want was sold out. the lavender tile motif is the one i got in my ideal size medium petite and it fits the best. what i do not like is that the inside of the skirt is white, which features prominently because of the high side slits. makes the dress look low quality. my favorite dresses were the solid teal and solid black. however the small was too small on my bust and the large petite was too large on my bust. i'm wondering if wash th
3466	1	a	These lightweight, wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute, but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide, adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
3467	0	a	Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.
3468	1	a	I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!
3469	1	a	At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they did not have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. all in all, it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.it does run tts.
3470	0	a	I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
3471	0	a	While i love the design and shape of this blouse, the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.
3472	1	a	I love this dress. i wish i had ordered a size bigger because now its out of stock. if you are between sizes order a size up. i'm in between a 4 and a 6 petite and ordered the size 4 and the dress is too tight in the bust. the dress has no give so it has to fit perfect. it is so lovely i do not want to return it. i will try to find a seamstress to help with the fit. my favorite part of the dress are the side pockets. they're big and adorable.
3473	0	a	This is such a beautiful dress. but have to return for the reasons others have noted. the chest does not fit well.
3474	1	a	Great little dress for a picnic. i am a 34dd and did not have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer. i had purchased a size 8. my only reason for return was the price and my wallet! otherwise this well-made dress would still be in my closet! love the buttons.
3475	1	a	I saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price. i was very happy when it went on sale. the top clings nicely without feeling tight. i got sp (5'5, 125)as i worried the neckline would slip off. fits perfectly. fabric has a very slight sheen. i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless.
3476	0	a	I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.
3477	1	a	The shirt looks so much more flattering on the body than on the hanger. it has a luxuriously soft feel without compromising fabric quality. i purchased both the white and navy color. indeed, a closet staple.
3478	1	a	The colors of this top are my favorite part, i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
3479	1	a	This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!
3480	1	a	This shirt is wonderful! i totally recommend it for everyone.
3481	0	a	Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i did not want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i was not neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it did not work out.
3482	0	a	I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost did not try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).
3483	1	a	The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!
3484	1	a	"I love this dress--i saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on. i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all, nor do i think it looks cheap--on the contrary. the shape is indeed boxy, but it is still very flattering and comfortable. i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments. the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned. for reference, i am 5'6 1/2"" and usually wear"
3485	0	a	Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.
3486	1	a	I bought this dress in a store, and it suits the body better than on the picture. the pattern is exquisite and beautiful, i receive compliments every time i wear it. it is made of silk, which is a preferred alternative to polyester. but as other reviewers mentioned, it needs a slip, and for an expensive dress it should come with one, or should be fully lined. it is only lined on top. the peep hole is deep, but on my body, it does not gap much (i'm 5'7'' 142 lbs). a keeper for me for its beauty!
3487	1	a	I ordered this online and really loved the picture. when i received the dress, it was lovely, but the color was more purplish-plum than red, and the fabric was super thick and a little too stiff. i was still hopeful, but when i tried it on, it was not flattering. the lines of the dress are very sculpted -- for example, the waist nips in, which would be good, but the place it nipped in was not at my waist (i am very short-waisted with longer legs and often have this problem with dresses). often wi
3488	1	a	"The quality of the fabric these are made from is wonderful- they are soft yet structured and i was so bummed they did not fit me. i usually wear a size 28 in premium denim so i ordered a 28 and i could barely pull these up over my hips. once i pulled them on i was about 1-2 inches from being able to zip them closed. the pants fit in the legs but they were very close-fitting, which is not the look i'm going for. i am 5'5"" and was worried they would look too long since usually pants are for me, but"
3489	0	a	"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details , but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out, but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope"
3490	1	a	If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it flowy comfortable and a must have!
3491	1	a	This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!
3492	1	a	I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a
3493	1	a	I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
3494	1	a	I travel a lot and like to wear something other than jeans when i go out in europe. these pants are comfortable and yet i can dress them up. great fit and really nice fabric. i bought these in two colors.
3495	1	a	Great shirt. i could not picture the material but it washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.
3496	1	a	What a great piece. so unique and so cool and made with high quality textiles. i expect this to be in heavy rotation. can go super casual/luxe with leather joggers or upscale with nice jeans and some heels.
3497	0	a	I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
3498	1	a	I do not have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it
3499	0	a	I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit, so i went for this one. unfortunately, the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me. the middle where the tops meets the bottom, is squared off, not like that v that it looks like in this photo. it also makes for major side boob/sagging on each side. i was very disappointed.
3500	1	a	"This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments. it form fitting but comfortable. it is just the right mix of classy and sexy. you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple. i am 5'6"", 150lb with an athletic build and a size 8 fit perfectly. i will be wearing this dress for years to come."
3501	1	a	When i'm looking for something comfortable to wear that looks effortless and cool, this is the top i pick! i ended up buying it in navy too. it really soft, ur washes well, and it great quality! a must have.
3502	1	a	"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"
3503	1	a	"Everything about this dress is perfect...the material, style, and fit. flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'9"" and the length was just above the knee. you can dress it up or down. comfortable. i definitely recommend."
3504	0	a	I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style. however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps. i even tried a different style bra and had the same result. sadly i returned it yesterday.
3505	1	a	I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!
3506	1	a	Pale pink is a hard color to find these days. very happy with this purchase,this dress is sweet, and a perfect transition piece from summer to fall in socal.i have a number of maeve dresses and they are all oversized, so the 2 fit as expected. i'm normally a 4 in every other brand.it can easily be worn with flats or wedges, or i imagine booties as the weather cools.
3507	0	a	First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i would not have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
3508	1	a	Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.
3509	1	a	"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them."
3510	1	a	This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w
3511	1	a	This dress is my new best friend. i've been looking for work dresses that do not require much effort in putting together an outfit, and this is just it! the pattern is fun and unique (i got many compliments), the cut is comfortable, flattering and feminine. the dress really speaks for itself, and all i have to do is throw it on and run out the door. the only negative is there was a loose piece of thread at the bottom (fingers crossed this does not lead to problems later on) and the sleeve buttons
3512	0	a	Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
3513	1	a	This is a perfect dress for work or fun. flattering and flow with lovely little subtle details.
3514	1	a	"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
3515	0	a	I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i did not think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just did not look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it does not lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.
3516	1	a	This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy, but the dress does not feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous, but still subtle. it a little too nice for me to wear to work, but the perfect special occasion or party dress
3517	1	a	This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!
3518	1	a	I really like this skirt. it is soft and the length is just right. i hate skirts that go below the knee. the only thing i do not care for is that there seems to be extra fabric in the back... maybe i should had ordered a size down. and the skirt does wrinkle easily. still, not enough reasons to send back. i have had many compliments at work.
3519	1	a	Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it a nice surprise.
3520	1	a	"I agree with the other reviewer that the color is not as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:__________pros:- pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.- the material is lovely and breathable. i did not find it sheer at all! of course, i did not wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.- runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i"
3521	1	a	This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they did not because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea
3522	1	a	Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
3523	1	a	I bought this dress in the blue print and love it! the drape is lovely and its not too short. i feel like it can be dressed up or down. i plan to wear it to a wedding at the end of the month. for reference, my measurements are 36-27-38 (chest 36d and height 5'4) and i ordered the small. i'm usually a small-medium but went with a small based on other reviews. i have a short torso as well and i feel this dress fits perfectly, not too small or too large. as other reviewers stated, there is no linin
3524	1	a	I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online. i could not be happier with it. it is very comfortable, flattering and unique. i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies.
3525	1	a	This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!
3526	1	a	This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!
3527	1	a	This is really a lovely top, but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit, the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the
3528	1	a	The weight of this denim is perfect, thin enough for a nice drape and wearability for all seasons but still thick enough to be structured. though there is absolutely no stretch, which is probably why so many are finding it to run small. i am a true size 6, but find that most retailer brands run quite large, therefore i usually wear a 4 and that what i purchased in this dress. the bodice is a bit snug, but not enough to size up, for me personally. i know it mostly a spring/summer dress,
3529	0	a	Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
3530	0	a	I fell in love with this dress online, but it just does not look as nice in person. first of all, it huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this, and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however, after seeing it in person, i did not love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit.
3531	1	a	"""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden..""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre"
3532	1	a	"From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5""1 and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and could not be happier"
3533	1	a	This is my new favorite dress. it a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.
3534	1	a	I love the style of this top, there good stretch to the fabric so it very flattering. the length is good for me, as the previous review stated, it a little long but for me it lengthening. the lace is lovely, too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.
3535	1	a	I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else! they are super comfortable, with great pockets. very flattering and wash up great. wish they made more colors...
3536	1	a	I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it beautiful! it delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it does not hit me completely on the waist, but it still very flattering.
3537	1	a	I do not love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me, and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs, so i ca not size down. the knit is substantial, so that something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just was not flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke tideline pencil skirt, which also has a fabric tie wrap
3538	1	a	Thank goodness i looked at everyone reviews beforehand because i ordered a size up (4) and it fits perfectly. i am usually a size 2 but can definitely tell it would not have fit correctly had i ordered a 2. the orange color works well for either a fall dress with leggins or a spring dress by itself. i love it!
3539	1	a	Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!
3540	1	a	I recommend this product if you are tall. the pants fit great but they are too long. im 5'7' and they drag on the ground.
3541	1	a	I saw this shirt in store a while ago, but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however, when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%, i decided to get it. i like the top, it cute and fun. however, it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts, and it is cute, but definitely not worth full price for this.
3542	1	a	"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase, and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try, and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7"", 120lbs, slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short, but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi"
3543	1	a	Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!
3544	1	a	I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be, but overall, it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!!
3545	1	a	I love tiny aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress does not disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec
3546	1	a	This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors, drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.
3547	1	a	I ca not say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers. it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love
3548	1	a	This sweater vest is versatile and adorable -- just runs very small. i normally wear an xs from retailer, and just exchanged for a medium. hoping that fits much better. i could not even get the xs on.
3549	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
3550	0	a	I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
3551	1	a	These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit, classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming, but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot), or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day, roll them up for ca
3552	1	a	"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut, and it already lined so i ca not see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape, and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally, it an awkward, unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee."
3553	1	a	These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but does not affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i'm
3554	1	a	I love the off the shoulder trend but do not like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe.
3555	1	a	I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs, i'd skip this one. however, if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
3556	1	a	I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so do not size down. i do wish the fabric was not
3557	1	a	"I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70 but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!"
3558	0	a	This jacket is soft, a beautiful color, the perfect length, and incredibly versatile (a fleece jacket that doubles as a blazer) but i was swimming in it! i would not have minded the larger size, but the sleeves looked ridiculous. i wish i'd ordered early enough to try a petite size, but i'm not sure that would've helped. sad to send this back!
3559	1	a	Very flattering. i am 36c and short torso and the small fit like a glove . the medium was a bit loose and gapped some on the side of my breasts. need to wear strapless bra. really cute style and goes with several of the patterned capri pants i bought at retailer this spring !!
3560	1	a	"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but was not billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do."
3561	1	a	This lightweight sweater arrived within a few days of ordering and was packaged well. its fit is true to size and will be perfect for slightly cool days and evenings. the navy blue color is accurately represented in the picture. my only issue with this item is that one of the small lace panels at the hem on the hip is not sewn in all the way. i will keep it since it was on sale, but i need to decide whether to have it fixed or to just remove both of them as they are very small and do not add much
3562	1	a	I got this dress for my younger sister who in the process of losing weight. she currently wearing a size 12 with comfort room but can occasionally squeeze into smaller sizes depending on the product. this dress is deceptively true to size. at first glance it looks like a roomy dress but the inner part of the dress zips up real tight. as a result, the boxy top part of the dress does not look too big and is in fact very flattering. the dress is very silky and looks as high quality as its price.
3563	0	a	This dress looked like something i would wear and covet for years. unfortunately it was loose in the places where it should show shape and was tight in others. the bodice is incredibly small and not meant for bigger chested women. while the fabric is beautiful, overall the dress did not look like much. disappointed.
3564	1	a	The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short. perfect length as well! dress up or down. love these shorts and wish there were more colors!
3565	1	a	Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.
3566	1	a	"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me."
3567	1	a	I ordered this a few weeks ago on major sale. im quite tall (5'11) so i went with the m/l to ensure that the length would work. its definitely long enough, almost a little too big, but i like the slouchy look. my only real complaint is that its a bit itchy. other than that i think its a great buy!
3568	1	a	"This dress is a beautiful classic ! i am 5""3 113 size 0 fits perfectly !"
3569	1	a	I wore this top recently and received several compliments. it a great top with the off the shoulder trend, plus you can wear a normal bra underneath! runs large so i recommend one size down.
3570	1	a	I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi
3571	1	a	Love the style of this sweater and it just happens to be warm, too!
3572	1	a	This sweater is very pretty but the material is extremely thin. the blue was ok but the white is nearly see-through. the design is unique but unless it fits really well, the bottom hem where it criss-crosses can bunch out in a weird way. i got my usual s and it was rather loose, causing this to happen. i suggest you size down if you want it to look smooth like it does on the model.
3573	1	a	Fun and elegant!this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials, as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear
3574	1	a	I can understand the concerns of another reviewer about shrinkage. i have a few retailer tops made of similar fabric and they have shrunk a bit. this too fits very well, but once i wash it, it will likely get a bit smaller. i ordered a small, but plan to size up to a medium. for ref. 32ddd bust, and the small fit perfectly with a camo underneath...the shoulders seem to be cut small. so if you are busty like me, size up.
3575	1	a	I've been looking at these online for a while now, and could not decide if they'd fit me or not. i have large, muscular thighs and pants always run tight. when i was in the store today i decided to try them on anyway, and boy am i glad i did. the fabric is super soft, as everyone else mentions, and they are nice and loose, but also look like ankle pants. i actually sized down! (who does not love it when they get to do that?!) i loved the way they fit so much, i bought two pairs. i love the pastel
3576	1	a	This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they did not wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
3577	1	a	Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i'm usually a 10, but still a little snug.
3578	1	a	I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!
3579	1	a	Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather, which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels, booties or flats making it extremely versatile.
3580	1	a	Beautifully made, incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places, which feels strange), but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i'm gonna return and buy the size down.
3581	1	a	Love this top! perfect for fall/winter! it does run large but it looks great! love!
3582	0	a	Tried this dress on today in the store. i am a size 10, sometimes a size 8. the size 12 was the first size i tried that zipped all the way up. however it was still very tight around my stomach and bust. and then from having to size up, it flared out too much at the bottom for my liking
3583	1	a	I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring
3584	1	a	The photo does not do this top justice. the design of this peplum is very slimming and the colors are complimentary to any skin tone. i usually wear a m (10) but purchased the l based on other reviews. it fits perfectly. would highly recommend!
3585	0	a	This coat is awful, just awful. i bought it based on the reviews, my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it was not like another puffer coat, it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear, but the look, style, and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!
3586	1	a	"So i ordered both sizes in this, small and xs. i'm 128 lbs. and 5""4 and the xs fit me. at first i was not sure about this piece but after getting it on it starts to grow on you. the top part of the jumper fits really cute and the bottoms are very wide and can be long. i did get this at a great price so i'm going to keep it, do not know how many times i will end up wearing but thought it would be really cute to wear out on date night with my husband."
3587	0	a	I really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body. will have to return.
3588	0	a	The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
3589	1	a	I was looking for a new spring/summer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it. it has a nice swing to it that is not too wide (think a flattering a-line cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem.) it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be (the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you do not get lost in the top. it not boxy or oversized, but if you want a fitted and more flattering look, you can definitely size down easily, parti
3590	1	a	I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.
3591	1	a	I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend.
3592	0	a	The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me.
3593	1	a	Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.
3594	1	a	I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it does not seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first.
3595	1	a	This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips. it fits very close through the behind --but is stretchy. as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely, i thought it would never work - but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings. and the stretch allows plenty of movement. if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top. so i will just wear it with spanx. th
3596	0	a	When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
3597	1	a	"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!"
3598	1	a	I own several of these tops and i love them. i am 5'10, 140 lbs and i wear a small. i bought the gray and white stripe and the ivory and black stripe and they are very flattering. the front hits me at the same place as it does on the model and the back covers my butt. i own several of the solid colors in this style as well and they are just as great. this shirt is so soft and comfortable, you wo not regret buying it!
3599	1	a	I have been eyeballing this shirt online. during my visit yesterday an associate just happened to bring one out for me to try on as my store had just gotten it in. happy coincidence! the fabric is very soft and comfortable with some give/stretch. the sleeves seem sturdy like they will hold up in the wash. i thought the shoulder area was fitted but not too snug, however i have smallish shoulders. the v neck was not too low (no cami needed) but low enough to be a little sexy/not dowdy. it fai
3600	1	a	"Bought pink and cream colors on sale. arm holes on my usual size medium were large so bought smalls and like them a lot. i'm 5'9"" and longer front and back worked well. fabric weave nice weight and good for summer or cooler with sweater or jacket over it."
3601	1	a	I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i did not sit and eat... we shall see. i do not plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling
3602	1	a	I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)
3603	1	a	Extremely soft and comfortable. fit very well. should travel really well.
3604	1	a	I bought this top in white and my usual size large based on other reviews. the sleeves are wonderfully long enough for this tall girl, which means that they are likely very long on shorter gals. i love the style of this t. the white is slightly see through, but with a nude color bra works ok. i do wish that it did not cut up so high on the sides. this probably is not an issue with shorter people, but i need to wear something under it to avoid showing skin. i've tried a white camisole under an
3605	1	a	I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for.
3606	1	a	I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well.
3607	1	a	Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist does not roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops
3608	0	a	This dress is very cute on the model online, but in person it is quite large and just hands there and does not do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
3609	0	a	I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it possible i should have sized down to a small, but i'm sending it back.
3610	1	a	Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend!
3611	1	a	"This dress is absolutely charming. i could not find the petite size, so i went with the 0 regular. it was too, too large for me. felt more like a size 4. i am 5'2"" and 112 pounds, thought the 0 would fit. the fabric is soft, the style charming and it is easy to fold and take on a trip- it did not wrinkle in the package it was shipped in."
3612	1	a	Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect.
3613	1	a	I was skeptical when i saw it online. i was not sure about the white background. but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online. i ordered s and xs. i was really surprised how well this dress fits. i am 5.4 and about 126 lbs, pear shape. the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy. the cut is slimming, flattering and structured. i decided to keep the xs size. i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer.
3614	1	a	"Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did, it is lovely! i ca not wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"", i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)"
3615	1	a	The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it, then it might be for you, but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
3616	1	a	Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes, running shoes or boots. fit well and true to size.
3617	1	a	This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i'm typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you could not even really c
3618	0	a	"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs., 34b, and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but was not at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews, i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however, i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half, thereby making me look larger than i am, so i sent it back. otherwise, this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein"
3619	1	a	I loved the colors of this vibrant dress. the beading is fabulous. the dress does run small, i sized up one size. i wore it out and got a lot of compliments
3620	1	a	The material is structured enough to flatter the body. only concern was over time the straps may wither as they are thin. very happy with the style and comfort of this jumpsuit. pockets on side are also useful yet discreet.
3621	0	a	"5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, 4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist, but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it meant to be blousey, but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned, i might give it a shot. but i ca not imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color, transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh"
3622	1	a	This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i ca not wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.
3623	1	a	Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation, i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they do not carry it in stores, i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all, i d
3624	0	a	This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.
3625	1	a	I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i could not be happier, i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
3626	1	a	It is the cutest detailed little white top. i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf.
3627	1	a	I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!
3628	1	a	These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.
3629	0	a	I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.
3630	1	a	Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!
3631	1	a	"When this appeared on line, i thought t would be a sure thing, color (blue), cut and style, this dress appeared to have been made for me, but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5"" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a"
3632	0	a	1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.4. very polyester with lots of static.5. cute idea, but not very good in pe
3633	0	a	I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but did not even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
3634	1	a	The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue
3635	1	a	Lovely assemblage of prints, looks great in motion. but the waistband runs a touch large. if you're between sizes, maybe size down.
3636	1	a	"One of my new absolute favs! so elegant and flattering. the dress is as appears online and it is true to size. i purchased my usual size 4 with 27"" waist, chest 34 b/c. note, that there is not a lot of give to the fabric, so busty women may need to size up. purchased with the minuet necklace!"
3637	1	a	Love this cardigan! it is a really a sweet and sexy top. so flattering to curves and yet conceals too. the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy.
3638	1	a	Like the other reviewer said, the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue, and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom, and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly.
3639	1	a	The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
3640	1	a	Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!
3641	1	a	I was not going to purchase this jacket thinking it was too pricely but i am glad that i did. true to size and made with great craftsmanship. it looks very delicate but made strong. very pretty .... true too picture. it works out perfect for after yoga!
3642	1	a	This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.
3643	0	a	So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
3644	1	a	Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines, softness, and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.
3645	1	a	Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.
3646	0	a	Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i were not careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps
3647	1	a	Wonderful flattering fit, mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection. i bought 3 pair. thrilled with pilcro. only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa. cuffs roll down if you want less sun.
3648	1	a	I agree that the color in the picture online is lighter but i bought it from the store and really like that it is not just another off-white sweater. it fits true to size and i love the quality. it is really beautiful!
3649	0	a	"I love this dress. it an unusual material and really adorable in person. the problem was that it runs so large that i could not make it work. i'm usually an xs regular. the xs swallowed me. so then i ordered it in a pxs and pxxs because i really wanted it to work. only the pxxs fit, but it was so short that there was no way i could make it work. and i'm only 5'1"". i am 51 years old so i am not comfortable wearing ultra short dresses. maybe a person who does not mind really short would be able to"
3650	0	a	I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
3651	1	a	I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.
3652	1	a	I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist, the lapel does not lay flat, but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist, you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.
3653	1	a	Very comfortable great quality with beautiful crocheted front top and lovely blend of colors
3654	1	a	I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it super comfy but i do find at retailer that it best to try things on in the store (it hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).
3655	1	a	"My review of the pros : 1) quality made, not see through in any way, can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look"", really liked it. my review of the cons, which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2"", 36 small c, broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs, which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2""), this a a"
3656	1	a	This top is great for spring- it super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what you're wearing it for. fits true to size and is great quality.
3657	0	a	The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy, but they just looked sloppy. also, the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft, but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
3658	1	a	Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy, i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.
3659	0	a	Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.
3660	1	a	I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- it not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.
3661	1	a	This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i ca not wear it enough.
3662	0	a	Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
3663	1	a	I ordered bought a medium for a comfortable fit. the material is stretchy, so size down for a body - hugging fit.
3664	1	a	This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
3665	1	a	I love this dress .perfect fit and very good quality.
3666	1	a	This dress is an absolute win. i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabric lightweight nature, and then i tried it on. such a good fit for my high waist, and the tie was super flattering. i love this with booties as i was wearing today, but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look. it also the rare three season dress, with its cut and coloring working most of the year. for sizing, i'd say it true to size. i got my regular size s with no trouble with
3667	1	a	I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.
3668	1	a	This very unique dress is exquisite and so versatile ? suitable for daytime or evening, and will look great with a cardigan and tights for year-round wear. it fits perfectly and seems true to size to me ? i?m 5?2?, about 112 pounds, and got an xs. the description says the dress can be machine washed, but with the delicate trim around the neckline, i plan to hand-wash it carefully. so happy with this purchase!
3669	1	a	Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price, but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!
3670	1	a	Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!
3671	1	a	"I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5"" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts"
3672	1	a	This is a gorgeous top. it is a very soft fabric that drapes beautifully. i purchased the red print - i tried both on in the store. the red really pops. i've onlyowed this top for a week and i've received many compliments on it.
3673	1	a	Dress is very pretty, but very short, almost tunic length.
3674	1	a	These are so comfortable, it like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really ca not be the comfort.
3675	1	a	I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o
3676	1	a	"This dress is beautiful! the concept looked really striking online and it really delivered in person. the material is a good weight for winter but soft and really quite luxurious. the collar is subtle and adds a lot of elegance.there not a lot of stretch though. i'm 5'5"", 130lbs, and usually btw xs, xsp, s, and sp and will probably go with the s on this one. you have to try this on!"
3677	1	a	I wear these pants 3-4 days a week. i work in advertising, so they go perfectly with the polished/ trendy/ casual office attire that is required! they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own-- and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight. they are a unique type of material, a soft but structured stretch weave-- so more polished than normal jeggings-- and smooth over bumps, while still highlighting subtle curves. the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish, but also provide a more
3678	1	a	This sweater vest is the best! it is so versatile! i've already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day. the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy. i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well! it makes coordinating easy. i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot, but thankfully it not at all. runs true to size. worth full price!
3679	0	a	I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.needless to say, they were returned.
3680	1	a	The cut is lovely and the fabric is wonderful-it a little thicker than you might think so it felt a little warm.i am sending back as i have a little belly and it does not hide much-but it did make my boobs look awesome:)
3681	1	a	"This dress is everything everyone said it was in the reviews. so cute and beautifully made. fully lined.i felt it ran a bit small as i had to return it for the next size up, more so in the bust area. but the fit and length was perfect in the size 6. 5""10, 125lbs. i will say that all the raving reviews made me purchasethe dress without hesitation and i'm sure glad i did!"
3682	1	a	This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it is not stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu
3683	1	a	Have not decided if i'm going to keep this dress yet. it arrived torn at the seams, but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted. in my opinion it is not worth full price. i would say it runs tts. i'm between and 4 and a 6 and the size sp fit perfect, however, the petite size runs pretty long. it says 47 inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with 5 inch heels. mine may have been a wrong size marked issue.dress looks exactly as in the picture.
3684	0	a	"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and did not cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on"
3685	1	a	I agree with the other reviews - it a little small in the arms, low cut in the chest, but really broad in the shoulders. i bought the xsp, which is a size up from my normal xxsp. they did not have xxsp to compare. and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders, and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else. overall, an excellent buy at the sale price. size up for more room in the chest and arms.
3686	1	a	As a mom, items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash, comfortable to run around in with my kids, and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless. these fit the bill on all counts. they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light, flowing top.these have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made.
3687	0	a	These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.
3688	1	a	"I sized down in this dress from a 6 to a 4 (32d-31-38). the 6 was too blousy in the bust and it did feel ""sack-like"". i sized down and suddenly it looked great--fitted enough through the bust and hips. be warned--this dress has to be pulled over your head. the fit in the bust will determine a lot. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and the length was great--similar to the model in the photo. the cream and black print is gorgeous."
3689	1	a	I have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find. they feel great, fit well, the price was good even before i got them on sale, i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of. wish they came in more colors..
3690	1	a	"This just arrived today. the material is very soft and i love the olive color. it has a zipper in the back but i was able to easily slip this over my head, making me think it runs a bit large. because it is loose the fact that the drop waist hits right at the hip does not bother me, though i thought it would fall a little lower. i am only 5'2"" and i consider this to be a short dress. with thick leggings i think it will be great winter dress. the bodice is fully lined (the skirt is not) and the ne"
3691	1	a	I also agree that this piece ran very small. my normal size did not zip up. i sized up a size, and it pulled across my thighs. i sized up two sizes, and it fit as i had hoped it would. if you get the right size, it is beautiful on. the colors are so fun, and i love the side slit. i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer, and it is definitely a statement piece.
3692	1	a	This dress is adorable! i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter' s bridal shower. i received so many compliments. it was comfortable, stylish and best of all wrinkle free. i actually ordered it online and when i got it, the dress required no ironing of any kind. love it! i think i may have to get in in the red also.
3693	1	a	Perfect for the change in weather, this sweater is very thick and a tad big. i would say it is true to size, but if you're like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear, do not. there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome. the color is a bit different than that shown; it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined. just a note, the pin does not come with the sweater; the closeup made me think it did, but it really does not matter. the color
3694	1	a	I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors. i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft! i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in. i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!
3695	1	a	Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round.
3696	0	a	I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would've maybe fit me in this top. it so billowy and not fitted at all.
3697	1	a	I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute, great transition piece into spring.
3698	1	a	This jacket has great style, is really comfortable, and looks good with jeans or nice pants. i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small. the medium is a better fit.
3699	0	a	Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.
3700	1	a	I love this t-shirt! it a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!
3701	1	a	This is the perfect little shirt when you want more than an ordinary t-shirt. the pattern on the back panel adds a nice little extra touch. the blue tone is very rich looking, and could be dressed up or down.
3702	0	a	I got fooled by this dress description. it 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
3703	1	a	Love this shirt. it perfect. it so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note, the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it a thin shirt and i know it wo not last a super long time, hence the back up.
3704	0	a	"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it not flattering at all. at $78, it really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what would not?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it a grey/black combo. it not... it is really green"
3705	1	a	Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.
3706	0	a	The fabric is really itchy, i felt like i was wearing a carpet, and it reminded me of the 70 fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.
3707	0	a	I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown.if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it.i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight.on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight.
3708	1	a	This dress is beautiful. however, it should be noted that there is a gold threading detail throughout the dress, which is not pictured. the dress appears to be a solid cream print in the pics but in person it has gold and cream. i sized up bc i did not want it to be too fitted, i'm between a 6 snd 8 so i went w medium. it fits will but slightly big. i'd say tts though.
3709	1	a	I purchased another top, same brand, in the same style from retailer and really love it. the fabric is lightweight, which makes it great for multiple seasons. i travel extensively and these tops hand wash and hang to dry very nicely. i wear a gray tank under this one and love the look. i also like the long length. as usual, i will probably tack the neckline up an inch or so, so that it not so low - just my thing. overall, the pattern and the fabric are very nice. i usually wear an xs or s; i pur
3710	1	a	Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!
3711	1	a	I loved this dress so much, but it just did not work. i'm not particularly busty (36b) but it just did not work for me. i sized up several sizes from what i usually wear and it still was tight on the bust and then just looser around the arms as i went up. such a beautiful dress though - great quality and really adorable fit for someone who is built for it!
3712	1	a	"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available."
3713	0	a	This is more of a cover up than something you would wear out .
3714	0	a	The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc, nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix.it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base.
3715	1	a	Very comfy and easily could dress down or up!
3716	1	a	I adore a good vest, so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i do not wear cream often, but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it, took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl, and i was not thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line, and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin, or even w
3717	1	a	Such a gorgeous weight, cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style, (not sure what you would call it), is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4, 133 and 34dd. fit is tts, maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love
3718	1	a	I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!
3719	1	a	Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
3720	1	a	Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through, perfect length, perfect v-neck (no cami required), amazing colors, perfect shape, not tight (body skimming), does not poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color, but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee
3721	1	a	I was worried this sweater would be too tight, but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!
3722	1	a	I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i could not forget about it even though i did not try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!
3723	1	a	This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?
3724	1	a	Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants
3725	1	a	"I finally broke down and went on a christmas shopping spree at retailer for myself with hubby in tow as they are gifts from him.the skirt is a beautiful dark navy, super soft knit. very long with a texture pattern. i am 5'9"" and have put on a few pounds lately but typical wear and 8/10 and bought the large because i did not want to try it on. it works for me because i do not like skirts to cling to much. even my pencil skirts i like a more loose fit. normally id say a medium would probably f"
3726	1	a	These are very comfy and look great on! i would like to get a second pair in the lighter color.
3727	1	a	I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock. really great deep wine color, soft. more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture. love.
3728	1	a	I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies), and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect, fitted, white, button-down blouse for weeks, and i love this top! it figure flattering, true to size, and a cute, classy alternative to your basic white button down. i ca not wait to wear it! =]
3729	1	a	Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless, i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an
3730	1	a	I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.
3731	1	a	"This is a great ""go to"" top. it is not too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it does not go ""too"" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway."
3732	1	a	"Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it shape is unique, it very ""floaty"" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. the ""empire"" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & did not look odd on me. i am 5'6"" so it might overwhelm a petite frame."
3733	1	a	"I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5'3"" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon does not lie perfectly along the side seam, but i'm sure only i notice."
3734	1	a	"Ok ladies, i love the whole idea behind these pants..cargo, corduroy, what!!!!?? and in a cool different navy color, had to have them. i got my usual size but in petite (i'm 5'5.5"" with shorter legs longer torso, usually do not get petite in skinniest, but for some reason did this time) and i have to say the calves of these pants are like compression stockings! the waist and boodie are perfect, but the calves, yikes! but you know how when you want something to work so bad....i ordered my usual si"
3735	1	a	"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey, but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft, flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels, just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.thank you!!!!"
3736	1	a	This is a great staple piece for your closet. i do agree that it runs large. i am usually a small and ordered this in an xsmall and that was perfect for the billowy-ness of the top. i have a long torso and arms, so going with an xsmall made the arms slightly short on me. i do not see this as an issue as i just pull them up to 3/4 length on my arm (the sleeves are elastic so this is possible). i receive compliments every time i wear this top. it is beautiful and comfortable. i definitely recommen
3737	1	a	These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i
3738	1	a	I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size, but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it great for wedding guests, cocktail hours, or even work.
3739	1	a	A beautiful blouse;however, i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also, and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.
3740	1	a	I'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist, but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.
3741	1	a	Super comfortable..great layering piece or by itself...got lots of compliments at work.
3742	1	a	I am tall (5'11 and 3/4) and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio. i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them. i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be. however there was no need to alter these tops (making me think the tops typically run small). both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b
3743	0	a	The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
3744	1	a	I am so in love with these pants. i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter (i am already short) but these are awesome. the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great, but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pants-they will hold their shape. i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tie-top. these pants are long on me, but it is not surprising since i am pretty short, i am t
3745	0	a	Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!
3746	1	a	It looks a little more dressy in the picture but it cotton, soft and very comfortable.

3748	1	a	I love this shirt - beautiful casual wear, great with jeans!
3749	0	a	Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence..the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large(perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body).the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms;every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth;otherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav

3751	1	a	This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquﾃ｣ﾂｩs and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i wo not be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl
3752	1	a	I do not buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!
3753	1	a	This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs, bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!
3754	1	a	I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but did not want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.
3755	1	a	I love my new dress! it is comfy, classy and so easy to wear! you can dress it up or down with ease. i'm looking forward to seeing more styles from this designer. i hope soon!! do not miss out on this dress. it a must have for your wardrobe!
3756	1	a	Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think
3757	0	a	This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just is not any style to it - has to go back.
3758	1	a	I wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark! as mentioned before, this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well. however the embroidery is beautiful. i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability. ca not wait to wear it out.
3759	1	a	This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and, it extremely comfortable!
3760	1	a	Really nice thick fabric, yet lays really nice. scarf included, love the poncho style. will get me throught the end of pregnancy and will look great after as well!
3761	1	a	I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
3762	1	a	This shirt is super comfortable and super chic. it looks great and feels great.
3763	0	a	"I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely, but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3"" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops, this is for you. unfortunately, i had to return it."
3764	1	a	I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.
3765	1	a	"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!"
3766	1	a	I love this gown so much, i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy, beautiful, and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite, hands down.
3767	0	a	This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium, both fit, one tighter--obviously, but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i did not think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body, smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c, athletic build.
3768	1	a	Another really cute iop (i tried on the blue), but if you are short, you definitely ned a petite size. sofy fabric, and pretty pattern, like hte tie nexk. too bad they sold out in my size...
3769	1	a	I ordered the black and white version online, and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured, heavier cloth, and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress, and i would highly recommend it!
3770	0	a	I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however, there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just was not flattering. i love the design idea though!
3771	1	a	It okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it not too baggy and it a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
3772	0	a	I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however, the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides, the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.
3773	0	a	Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
3774	1	a	I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.
3775	1	a	"The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5""- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf"
3776	1	a	I bought this sweater on a whim in the store, without trying it on. when i got home, i decided it would probably lose it shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later, desperate for something to wear, i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.this is a great sweater. layered with a cami, it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured, so it does not feel sloppy. it has w
3777	1	a	I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did! very cute and great fit! flattering too!
3778	1	a	"These are great, casual, comfy pants for summer. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs, usually a 25 or 26 in pants. the reg 25 was a better fit than the 26p."
3779	1	a	Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple, but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee.
3780	1	a	This dress is beautiful - the pictures do not do it justice. i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress - light and airy. i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back. too bad for me! i think the dress is perfect for weddings, parties and even everyday wear.
3781	1	a	"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there. the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"""
3782	1	a	This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 14 and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it bright & cheerful and dreamy.
3783	1	a	I was so excited when these pants went on sale! tried them on in-store and ordered online. tried both medium and small and they both work, thanks to the elastic waistline. they do run very long, so if you're super tall these are great, otherwise prepare to wear very tall heels or get them hemmed.
3784	1	a	Fabric quality is good, pattern is pretty in person. very comfortable! i'm not sure if it because i have an ample chest, but unfortunately it looked like a maternity shirt on me. it looks good from the front, but from other angles it looked bulky. i tried in both white and black, and i think the white looks better?the smocked top is more visible.
3785	0	a	This dress is so cute but it going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.
3786	0	a	I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
3787	1	a	Material is nice, great for a party or date night. fits true to size, (l for me, i'm a 12). would recommend. the bell sleeve is right on trend and very tasteful.
3788	1	a	I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality, with layers to ensure the top is not sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and do not show off any of my bra, which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o
3789	1	a	I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!
3790	1	a	"Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering, the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral, and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering, i originally bought hte xs in the store, but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs, 5'1.5"" and 30 dd, with 26-27 waist). both fit, but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also, the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried"
3791	1	a	"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)"
3792	1	a	I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.
3793	1	a	I love this sweater jacket! found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer! i am 5,4' inches and 34dd chest and curvy 145 lbs. the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item. the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink. i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones. i paired it with a pink blouse from anth
3794	1	a	This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.
3795	0	a	These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch, and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch, no less) . i got them in the gray, and it possible that other colors use different, less awful fabric.
3796	1	a	I love this summery blouse. it sits at high hip, so no tucking in! the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm. i own this same pattern in a knit, and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it. the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater.
3797	1	a	Like another reviewer, i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display... super cute and ultra comfy... the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall. i purchased this in the olive color and just love it. very cute and flattering for a poncho-type sweater. i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit. i highly recommend this item!
3798	0	a	"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed."
3799	1	a	I purchased this in the red & love the fabric and overall design of the top. i have returned it for a larger size. it is very small through the chest. hopefully, a larger size will give me more room though the chest without being too large in the rest of the shirt. i'm a 34 c and ordered a size 6 for reference.
3800	0	a	After eyeing this product online for awhile, i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did, because while this dress is lovely, it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h,) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally, the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders, which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft, and the
3801	1	a	I saw this dress online and loved it. i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an 8 and 10, but i think the 10 was sized wrong. anyhow, both were too small, so when i returned them, they were in the store! i ended up with a size 12 which fits great, with a little bit of room. it is light weight, simple but fun and very comfortable to wear. i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it. i also ordered it in white, thinking that i might prefer that color, but when it arri
3802	0	a	I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there the first reason i did not like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.this top is just reall
3803	0	a	I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau
3804	1	a	I'm a curvy person, so my review might not be suited to everyone. my standard size in retailer tops is xl, and it is the same for this blouse.-overall:overall gorgeous, well made blouse but i wish there was less fabric involved and the burnt out design did not make a horizontal stripe across the back and biceps. this blouse just might not work out as well if you are a full figured person.-pros:gorgeous blousehigh qualityunique-cons:i wish the burnt out design did not make a hor
3805	0	a	The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
3806	0	a	This dress is good quality but the designers today really need to design their clothing line with the busty woman in mind.
3807	1	a	The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!
3808	1	a	What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
3809	1	a	The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl
3810	1	a	Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.
3811	1	a	I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!
3812	0	a	I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just does not look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it is not sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it we
3813	1	a	I absolutely love this dress! it great for business casual. it also such a great color for the transition into fall.
3814	0	a	This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however, i do not think it will hold it shape after even just 1 wear. it also does not seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning, it wo not last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
3815	1	a	Super cute! no complaints! fun print! light weight soft material!
3816	1	a	This dress is so beautiful & fits my hourglass figure perfectly. it fully lined & the print is nicer in person. very easy dress to wear to many summer occasions! i'm an 8-10 on top & 10-12 on the bottom. size 10 dress fit perfectly!
3817	1	a	I loved this dress when i saw it mostly for its emerald color. i am tan with brown hair and features so green is a good color for me. the quality is very high with detailed embroidery and thick fabric. the dress comes with a slip which fits well but i do not think you'd have to wear based on the opaqueness of the fabric. the dress fits true to size but the cut is gracious through the hips. this is a relaxed fitting. drop waist dress.
3818	1	a	Great sweater - very pretty and warm. i would say it fits true to size, but the fit itself/style is just a little roomier - just like on the model. i usually take an xs and the xs fit great.the tag says to dry clean or hand wash in cold. i always wash my wool sweaters in cold water, in a garment bag, on delicate wash and have never had a problem.but, when i did that for this sweater, it shrunk to a size that would fit a 4 year old. the fabric in the arms stuck together, like velcro. very inter
3819	1	a	I really love the feel of the fabric on this dress. when you first take it from the package it resembles a tent, but once you figure out how to scrunch the front and back around the straps, it resembles the photo. the fabric is very soft and the indigo colors are amazing. this dress is perfect over a swimsuit or for casual gatherings. you can even dress it up with a belt. it is somewhat sheer, but does look cute with a cropped jacked over it.
3820	1	a	I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!
3821	1	a	"I found these jeans to be more fitted than slouchy. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 160#. i'm heavier thru the hips and thighs and ordered both the 31 & 32 petite (i usually take 32 p in pilcro) and the 32 fit well but was by no means slouchy. however, still very flattering and unique. i had purchased the other pilcro em in 32 p and they did fit looser and i would also recommend that style. always count on pilcro for great fit and style."
3822	1	a	This is the perfect summer top! lightweight and breezy. looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose. loved the blue one, so i came back to get the red one. (i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual.)
3823	1	a	I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just does not wor
3824	0	a	Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
3825	0	a	While this top is pretty, it very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it.
3826	1	a	I purchased this for travel for a work meeting, i paired black slim pants under with heels-i added a long simple necklace and it was perfection. after getting a little wrinkled in my suitcase, i simply hung up while i showered and the wrinkles fell right out.it was comfortable, traveled well, was light, but looked very professional. you could wear tights under with boots or i can see in the spring with fun nude shoes.dolan always hits a home run- every dolan piece i have i still wear, years l
3827	1	a	I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.
3828	1	a	These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.
3829	1	a	Love these shorts. such a pretty print!
3830	0	a	The quality and color is great on this top. the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look. and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look. it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right. the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.
3831	1	a	The colors are really lovely--bright and vibrant. the sleeve and back fabric is comfortable and breathable. it is dry-clean only because of the brocade, but definitely worth it! i'm usually s but preferred the xs fit.
3832	0	a	This dress did not work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
3833	0	a	I did not have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers, but this dress is incredibly long and large, especially compared to the picture. for reference, i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me, particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!
3834	1	a	Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!
3835	1	a	"I love the length of this top and i love tops that do not cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5"", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months."
3836	0	a	"Maybe it my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs, go for it! had to send back!"
3837	1	a	I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape, but when i put on the green one, i did not want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much, i purchased the blue as well. love, love, love!
3838	1	a	Love the color, cut, and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat, but longer and more appropriate for an office.)within two wears one of the buttons popped off.within three wears, one of the back shoulder seams had split.this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew, because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.
3839	1	a	So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.
3840	1	a	"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i do not feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner"
3841	1	a	This reminds me of the 1970. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store does not carry petites. it typical moth quality and fit. perfect.
3842	1	a	I love this dress! i was so excited when i saw this hanging in my local retailer, just one in my size (it must have been a return). i tried it on and fell in love with it! i am 34b bra size, 130 pounds, 5'9 tall and an xs fits me great! i did not find it to be tight on top for me, as other reviewers have said, and the skirt is very flowy. i have worn this dress so many times since i bought it and have gotten compliments on it each time. i bought the green color-- its a beautiful print, and usually
3843	1	a	These are super cute shorts - great pattern, pockets (yay!) and really nice fabric. but, they're just a little too short for me, run a little small, and the side zipper is something of a pain -- i do not know if it was a construction issue on the pair i received or a stupid user issue but it seemed as if the seam with the zipper was just off -- not really a side seam but more toward the back. plus, the zipper sticks on the waistband seam making it even more difficult to zip. i wish i had read the
3844	0	a	I love love love the soft fabric and the cozy cowl. however mine not only had a giant hole, it seemed like the yarn started pilling as soon as i touched it. love the idea, but not practical, even without a hole =)
3845	1	a	I chose this dress for my engagement photoshoot and i'm so glad i did! it is beyond beautiful, my favorite dress ever!
3846	0	a	I wore this for the first time today, and after just about an hour, it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack. its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(
3847	1	a	This dress is much prettier in person! colors are more vibrant and do not need to iron!!! the neckline was too low for me, so wore a light purple cami underneath which matched the purplish shade of the dress! perfect!!!
3848	0	a	"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning."
3849	1	a	I found my experience odering the moon lake maxi skirt very easy. i received the skirt in a timely manner and am very happy with my purchase.
3850	0	a	This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
3851	1	a	This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i
3852	1	a	Cute staple in classic style overall. fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra. many wardrobe options with this staple.
3853	1	a	Love! color and fabric are beautiful! new fav
3854	1	a	I had just bleached my hair really blonde and was in the mood for something pink, so when i saw the rose color of this sweater in the store it fit the bill. nice and easy to wear, a wee bit scratchy but not too bad.
3855	1	a	This maeve dress caught my eye for its unique styling, and did not disappoint in person. v-neckline is deep, but not revealing. there is a nice hemstitch detail on the sleeve trim. the pattern is a good scale for a strong frame.what surprised me: 1.) the dress is actually black with light brown flowers. on my screen, it looked brown with bronze flowers. 2.) there are pockets in this unlined dress! they are placed on-seam, but feel weirdly awkward to access, almost as if they are set back. they
3856	1	a	This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it
3857	1	a	I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult, but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.
3858	1	a	"I love elosie sleepwear, everything is well made and beautiful designs. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 4, the small fits great. i love the embroidery it is a nice touch, and the pink is a pretty contrast."
3859	1	a	I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.
3860	1	a	I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors, but this looked timeless and beautiful, like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined, and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted, but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also, heed t
3861	1	a	"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it."
3862	1	a	I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy)
3863	1	a	"I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend, who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft, and the color is great."
3864	1	a	Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum, the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.
3865	1	a	This dress is to die for. the picture does not do it justice. so pretty and dainty. perfect dress for a wedding.
3866	1	a	This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!
3867	1	a	I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.
3868	1	a	I love this! i can dress it up with a sharp white button down and skirt or match it with grey leggings and boots for easy sunday.
3869	1	a	I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco
3870	1	a	I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it. i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger. it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself). i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
3871	1	a	This shirt was better than expected. the fit is fitted but still flows. it comfortable and the material is great. it goes with anything, ive tucked it into pants and skirts but i've also just worn with leggings. looks great either way! im going to buy more of this shirt.
3872	1	a	Never want to take this tee off, so comfy, & neutral, ecru stripe, with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb! goes with a ton of items from my own closets! need more in every color/print/stripe......just feels ooh, soooo good
3873	1	a	I love the color combination, and the bodice is very falttering. it has a tiny bit of stretch. the tulle is also feminine, i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket... sizing: no need for petite, it was short enough in regualr size. i think petite would have been too short (unless you are younger:-))
3874	1	a	This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim, & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it slim through the shoulders and arms, and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light, but i love in so cal, so it great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies, heeled clogs, and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and the 8 fits perfectly.
3875	1	a	This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said, great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.
3876	1	a	Fit tts, very flattering and slimming with fitted thighs and slight flare. can be dressed up given the beautiful and classy dark wash. the hint of stretch makes them super comfortable. the only thing is, they are very long, will have to hem unless you are 6 ft tall. in my 5'5 case i'm afraid the hemming will take away some of the flare effect. ag, please make pants with realistic length! still, very happy, especially since i was lucky to get my size during a promo.
3877	1	a	Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it just right; i would not be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat.
3878	0	a	Love the blue color, and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair. the hem is cool. love the big cuffs. but i looked like the liberty bell in the small. it is huge through the hips! not at all like on th model. i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms. returned :(
3879	1	a	These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!
3880	1	a	Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out, or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality, not itchy.
3881	1	a	Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i've gotten many compliments! (5'8, 120 lbs, xsmall)
3882	0	a	The fabric was a beautiful color, but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning.
3883	1	a	Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.
3884	0	a	I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful, plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there is not a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest, away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.
3885	1	a	Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
3886	1	a	I love this dress! it has pockets in front. timeless. fun. dress up or down.
3887	0	a	This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.
3888	1	a	"I am 5'9"" and 138 pounds slender, but with a tummy. the small fit great ,and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary. the dress flounces out a little, but in a cute way, and it not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now. i did not think it looked that great on the hanger, but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected. got the brown. thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie, boot, moto jacket transition to"
3889	1	a	"This shirt is really cute. it shorter than most - and it supposed to be that way. if you do not want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt is not for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs."
3890	1	a	"I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening. i am ""curvy on bottom"" so i sized up from my normal retailer 4 to a 6 and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine. i'm 5'8"" 140 about 36-27-36 if it helps as i know it hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figure...my advice is to go up a size if you are. the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i"
3891	1	a	Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.
3892	1	a	I love this top. it was cool on a summers day. i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine, not ruined at all.
3893	1	a	I love everything about this top. it is high volume and looks good with either a skinny pant or a structured voluminous pant. very sharp, but feminine and frilly look. i love the juxtaposition.
3894	1	a	This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.
3895	1	a	The picture is accurate. i got the plum version. the color and effect are really unique. the fit is tts. i wear an 8 in tops and the medium is fine. the sleeves are flattering- belled but not ridiculous. the fabric is soft. if the body of the top was a little less wide it would be a 5 star item. with flare legs, i think it will balance out the volume of the cut.
3896	1	a	"Very long, so may need to hem if your inseam is under ~34"". beautiful trousers!"
3897	0	a	First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.
3898	1	a	This pants are comfortable and classy. they go fantastic with tall booties as it gets colder.
3899	1	a	This dress was overall cute, but you have to have an olive/darker complexion or a nice tan to really pull it off because it is such a pale pink. i'm very fare, but normally can do light punks, but this one just clashed. it does run pretty true to size. if you're on the edge between a smaller or bigger size, i recommend the smaller size however. hope this helps y'all!
3900	1	a	I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you wo not be disappointed with this one.
3901	1	a	This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.
3902	1	a	I'm in between a medium and a large and i ended up with a large because of the sleeves, which are fitted. the sleeve looks loose on the model, but i have some muscle on my bones. the v-neck is a little low and i will probably war a cami underneath, something i would have done in a medium as well. overall i like the top, i got the green. it has a nice style and will stand alone in warmer months without a jacket or sweater over it.
3903	1	a	Ordered my usual medium. it swallowed me. have returned to store and they ordered me a small to try. very cute comfortable top
3904	0	a	The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
3905	1	a	I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt, however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have), so i ordered it in the regular small. it perfect in length, but a little loose on top, which i'm fine with. overall, very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.
3906	0	a	"I'm a rather small person--5'2"", about 100 lbs, 32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer sizing is a bit all over the place, i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs, planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee, but even as petite as i am, i coul"
3907	1	a	I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it warm yet flattering and i love the color.
3908	1	a	I have these pants in the blue/grey color and like them so much i got them in olive. wash well, fit perfectly... easy to throw on and look great!!
3909	1	a	I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey, even on sale), but so far it the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side, but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips, but it pretty loose on top--y
3910	1	a	This top has gorgeous embroidery, very very nice, looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl, i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust, and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering, because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i do not like the fit at all.
3911	1	a	Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.
3912	1	a	Do not listen to other reviews- this runs large not small. i have a 34d and i usually wear a 4 in most retailer dresses. therefor after reading the reviews, i ordered a 6. i was swimming in it. just ordered a 2p and 2 to see which will fit. the design is stunning and it very well made. i'm hoping for the perfect fit once the dresses arrive.
3913	1	a	Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top
3914	1	a	I was not sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it. plus it is very comfortable. i would highly recommend it!
3915	1	a	I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very high-quality. since it linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular, which i found slightly big i
3916	1	a	Such a beautiful, flattering dress! i bought this to wear for our anniversary dinner and received so many compliments.
3917	1	a	This shirt is boxy. but, as the pictures clearly shows, that is the design of it. if you know how to style outfits, it a great buy. i really like it. i'm tall and slender, so it a bit easier for me to pull this off. the design and color are just really neat. really cool shirt for the fall.
3918	0	a	This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold, gentle, cycle and they were stained/ i will return these -it too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
3919	1	a	The material is beautiful and as others said its a bit fuller than one might think. i am returning because it high waisted with a thick elastic waist band. not my style - i suppose it would work with a thick belt. as i said its beautiful - just not my style.
3920	0	a	This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely, but between the fit and the scratchy fabric, this is headed back. too bad!
3921	1	a	Bought the camel color and love it. nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall. soft and comfortable. delicate yet not too much so that you would not wear often.
3922	0	a	I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just did not have the time to return it to the store.
3923	1	a	This has a very nice hang to it- combination of the cut and linen- like fabric. i liked it so much that i bought two different colors. so many tees are blousy and full now;i am short so they look like maternity tops. this one is much more flattering.
3924	0	a	These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!
3925	1	a	I, sadly, only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big, i would need the petite, so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs, 30dd) - but it is adorable, can be dressed up and classy, casually with jeans, or sweetly, so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well, i am sure i will find something similar i love!
3926	0	a	"I'm so disappointed this dress did not work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. also the length was super long, description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def"
3927	1	a	This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i was not sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca
3928	1	a	This is a wonderful layering piece for the office. the material is so soft, like a thick velvet, but not quite. it is cute with a sleeveless body skimming top underneath, b/c it fits loosely. not for 90 degree days, as it is a bit of a heavier summer material. the orange-peach-coral color is really unique!
3929	1	a	This dress is stunning. it is a great classic, that i wished had worked out for me. i went through 3 different dresses, and each time, the cap sleeve would tear. there is not much room, if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing. i am so disappointed. it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it). if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner, it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!
3930	1	a	This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.
3931	1	a	I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet, as the weather is still very warm, but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft, i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing, i hope this is just an overlooked pos
3932	1	a	I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk, the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great, however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less, the fabulous swing shape would work. that said, i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house, if sale was on sale again.
3933	1	a	I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it
3934	1	a	"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i"
3935	1	a	The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it! i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else!
3936	1	a	After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace
3937	1	a	I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online, but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs, i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering.
3938	1	a	Love this big top...! will be great for hot summer days.
3939	1	a	I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it has not shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!
3940	1	a	Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just did not work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down.
3941	0	a	"Beautiful blouse in theory, however, on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it"
3942	1	a	This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being
3943	0	a	Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric, but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper, there room to go small if between sizes, be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who completel
3944	1	a	Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.
3945	1	a	This jacket is a perfect, lightweight cover for dresses as shown online, but will also look great with jeans and tops. the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality. the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more form-fitted. while its a masculine style, its has feminine details and fit. this is my third hei hei jacket, the sizes between them are consistent (i'm 5'4'', 125lbs. 34c and i wear an xs in this jacket) - each one i've worn a million times!
3946	1	a	I bought this on sale. the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves. a little see through, but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath.
3947	1	a	This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.
3948	1	a	I love this dress even more in person than in the photo! it is more sleek and fitted than it appears on the model. the seams are flattering and the fabric is lovely.
3949	1	a	I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes are not too large which is always a nice plus:)
3950	0	a	Just did not look as cute on me as the pics online. the color blocking was kind of odd actually. returning.
3951	1	a	It super soft. it fits great. happy with the purchase.
3952	1	a	Love these jeans. comfortable fit, does not stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up, lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes
3953	1	a	I saw this in the store on a mannequin in baltimore.....and i had to try it. it almost felt more like a sweatshirt than a true sweater. i found the top to be a shaped. smaller at the shoulders and chest and widening as it went down.the sleeves were rolled up which showed a soft peachy look underneath, which was cute. but i am on the fence on to which size to go with. like other reviewers have said, if you go up a size for shoulder comfort it gets a bit too swingy on the bottom. the length was n
3954	1	a	This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it pretty loose, but does not look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you do not want your bra to show through.
3955	1	a	I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color. ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!
3956	1	a	Such a pretty skirt. i think it a very versatile piece. a bit heavier, ca not wait to wear when it cools down more. i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too. note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does.
3957	1	a	"I love these pants. saw them in-store & could not do it at full price but they're a steal on sale. super soft & comfy. love the wide leg. fits true to size. i'm 5'2"" 125 lbs & ordered the xs bc no petite. waistband fits a bit tight but i prefer that to them slipping down. would buy again,"
3958	0	a	I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it, but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.
3959	1	a	These coveralls are not cut long enough, i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice, my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep
3960	1	a	Green- feminine and flattering, love this dress!!
3961	0	a	I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater does not flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and is not flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters
3962	1	a	This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!
3963	1	a	"I wanted a nice, well-fitting top that would work with trousers, jeans, and skirts alike, and be a nice wardrobe staple. i got two of these tops - one size s (black) and one m (turquoise). the size m is gigantic and i have to return it. the size s is also a whole lotta shirt. the top is really long and has a multi-level bottom, as well as the pocket, making it not just a simple top but a rather ""loud"" top. nevertheless, i'm keeping the size s (black) as a versatile shirt that i can hopefully tuc"
3964	1	a	This is a gorgeous blouse. the quality is on point. i was so disappointed because i had to return it.the blouse was just a few inches too tight across the bust.
3965	1	a	Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i've also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites.
3966	1	a	These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there is not much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really do not like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.
3967	0	a	This is such a great dress, i hate to return it. it pretty, a nice material, and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said, it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs, or if it came in petite, i would exchange it in a second. but since there not, it has to go back.
3968	0	a	I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it strange because it not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. i would
3969	0	a	I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
3970	1	a	I love this jacket over a dress! it snug fitting so ca not wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.
3971	0	a	Well - i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress. it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool / comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress.on the upside - the pattern is really pretty.
3972	0	a	This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.
3973	1	a	"This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2"",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr"
3974	1	a	Overall, the dress is beautiful, easy, and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo, if that makes sense. it not poofy or super-layered, but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part, the fit is true to size. but as a petit, the extra fabric is not what i'm looking for.i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
3975	1	a	"Surprised abt the prev review. i had picked mine up at the store a few months back. purchased my usual size s. it a little oversized & soft. the front pockets really do appeal to me as always w/ a cardi. i wear the light grey cowled t-neck top w/ it called the ""carra turtleneck"" w/ paige black skinnys. i have the other colors in the t-neck as well which go well w/ it also. worn a few times when cool but lately it been warm again. it abt to be cool again & look forward to wearing. very comf"
3976	1	a	I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t
3977	1	a	Great dress, love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel. the dress is well made, too!!
3978	1	a	I used my birthday month discount to treat myself to this gorgeous chemise and matching robe in the mauve. the color is prettier in person than on my computer. i bought it in size m, and size m clothes are normally a little big on me. this chemise fits, but there is no extra room or looseness. i am disappointed in the quality of the pieces. i have several beautiful 100% silk undergarments that i bought for myself in the 80s and 90s, and i am comparing this chemise (& robe) to those. this silk us
3979	1	a	This dress is beautiful. it is even prettier in person than in pictures... i was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail! i am 5'2, 125 lbs and went with a 4p, and it fit perfectly. (i typically do not like things to be extremely clingy). this could easily be dressed up or down. personally, i wore it to a wedding, and received many compliments on its uniqueness.
3980	1	a	I really liked this top, but it was very expensive even when on sale, and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a), 5'7'. if i remember correctly, i tried on the xs. it was cute, but it was not flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise, the quality seemed great, though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually.
3981	1	a	I could not wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i ca not wait to wear it!if i had to find a fault with this dress, it the lack of pockets. retailer d
3982	1	a	I love this top but make sure to size down! i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent! returned for an xs. overall, the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning. the orange is not too harsh. a keeper for sure!
3983	1	a	"I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i'm 5'7"" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty"
3984	1	a	This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm do not typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin
3985	1	a	This top is great - lightweight and flattering.i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.
3986	1	a	This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink, which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers, which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic, but it snug.
3987	1	a	I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!
3988	1	a	"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!"
3989	1	a	I usually wear a 6 for skirts and dresses, but when i got this in the mail, it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips. other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath!
3990	1	a	I loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it! i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but could not find anything that i fell in love with till this one. i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details. it just beautiful. my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah. after all the awesome going on in front, i was disappointed in the view from behind, but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon
3991	1	a	Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work. more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable. got lots of compliments.
3992	0	a	"The color of the sweater is beautiful, but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly, (i'm 5'1"", 108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item."
3993	1	a	Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it would not even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.
3994	1	a	This dress is beautiful, it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous, just not a good fit for me, even at a 0p.
3995	0	a	An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
3996	0	a	I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i would not wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i do not know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.
3997	1	a	This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online. when i went to a store, though, the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy, and i wanted to give it a chance. i tried it on and it fit like a glow! i am a 5'1'', 100 pounds, and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit. the length was great for me (petite size) and did not need altering. the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress. definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a
3998	1	a	I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it adorable and super comfy! it perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i ca not wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!
3999	1	a	"Love love love! i'm 5'8"", 122 lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2"" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y"
4000	1	a	"These are beautiful pants - pretty basic, but comfy and you can dress them up. they definitely run large in both length and waist. i'm 5'10"" and having a little bit of a platform or heel is helpful."
4001	1	a	This dress is just lovely. beautiful drape, comfortable material. it is a print that looks like embroidery. i am usually an xs or s, and i'm glad i got the xs as i can tell the s would have been too large. the back waistband is elastic and it is easy to move in. beautiful neutral colors. i think it can be dressed up or down easily with the right shoes and jewelry. only negative comments- there is only a half slip and i wish it was lined more, although that will make it easier to wear during the
4002	1	a	I love these pants. they are really comfortable without sacrificing style. perfect for the office or just running around. i'm 5ft 9inches and 165 lbs. i bought the medium which fits perfectly.
4003	0	a	Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite. in the past 6 months or so, i have bought 3 new pairs, and all have been so disappointing. first of all, the quality is horrible now. in the past, they would last for years and hold up great. my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month. also, pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way. they smell horrible despite washing. what happened, pilcro?!?!?
4004	1	a	Nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist. not too short for this 60+ body and very comfy. i wear either a med. or large and went with large for this. a good buy.
4005	1	a	This is a nice, easy, go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall. comfy, but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee.
4006	1	a	This chemise is so comfortable and beautiful. can be dressed up or down and is a staple of a bohemian wardrobe. gave 4 stars for the fact that it is completely see through and requires a (not included) slip underneath. also because the super thin cotton will wear easily.
4007	0	a	"The cut is small. i am 5'9"", 150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand."
4008	1	a	This is the prettiest little sweater with such nice details. but it will not work well on a person like me with a full bust (38d) even in a larger size than i normally wear. it is also very, very short in the body. i would recommend it for a petite person with a small bust though.
4009	1	a	"I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person."
4010	1	a	When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments! the quality is great along with the style.
4011	1	a	I just love these! i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size 28. they fit just right, just like my other pilcro jeans. i'm only 5' and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but that typical. i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good, not over-the-top. i'm so glad i got these! and the sale price was a bonus!
4012	1	a	I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great, i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest
4013	1	a	I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe would not feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!
4014	1	a	"Amazing pants! i saw them at my local retailer and knew they would be great addition to my wardrobe (in-person is even better than photo!). they are flattering and i love that the pattern lends itself to many options...could be an ivory sweater or blouse or perhaps a mustard jacket...so much fun! i am 135 lbs, 5'7"" and went with the 6."
4015	1	a	Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful, the embroidery is gorgeous, i feel so feminine in this coat
4016	1	a	These capri length pants are awesome! i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me (i am a 10-12 with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pants)--the fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing. super comfortable!
4017	0	a	I really, really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however, it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress, i ca not justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.
4018	0	a	I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
4019	1	a	Unfortunately this was too low cut for me,so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties, no matter how i fiddled, did not cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!
4020	1	a	"I wear this out, but it also a super comfortable to lounge around the house in. i measure 35"" 28"" 40"" (6 through the top, 10 in the bottom). i ordered a medium based on comments from other users concerning the top and it being constricting. i did not find that to be true, but for a closer fit i probably should have ordered the small. overall, this is a fun dress to wear."
4021	1	a	I knew once i saw this online that i would love it, because of that i almost feel like my review is biased. i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile. i own the holding horses version from a few years back, but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me (even though it has a drawstring waist). this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire. but it not too tight. i am small up top, 34b but larger
4022	1	a	Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!
4023	1	a	I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i would not spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but does not make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!
4024	1	a	I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
4025	1	a	What a fun dress to wear. it feels great, and looks great. i feel good when i wear it. if i was a kid i would wear it everyday, ha ha.
4026	1	a	This black dress is stunning...i've already worn it to a fashion show and a wedding and i received so many compliments!
4027	1	a	I really loved the uniqueness of this dress, and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work, but it was just a little too fitted for the office!
4028	1	a	I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!
4029	1	a	I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they do not make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo
4030	1	a	"I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it! on the site i thought it was just ""meh"" but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected. it definitely runs large, i sized down to an xs (usually a s, size 4/6) and it still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy, the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck is not at all tight. it soft and just an overall cute sweater!"
4031	0	a	On me this was not good at all. could not get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.
4032	1	a	The picture makes it looks like it has rich brown yellow and orange colors. when it came, it was more black with some orange that popped. much different then i expected. the material was nice and silky but i was not willing to keep something that was dry clean only. i sent it back.
4033	1	a	I am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique. be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering.
4034	1	a	Great quality and works in many ways! highly recommend.
4035	1	a	I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me, but i can see that if i were any larger chested, it might be an issue. (for reference, i'm a 32d, 5'4, 112lb.) it very forgiving on the tummy area, without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality, really comfortable, and it easy to wear with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc., making it a welcome versatile piece.
4036	1	a	I love these jeans! the perfect amount of stretch. very figure flattering. perfect for lounging around or a night out.
4037	0	a	I loved the colors on this dress, but i do not like the way it fits. it is tight around the shoulders, but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape
4038	1	a	"I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10"". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part."
4039	1	a	I like these jeans because they are long enough to wear with any kind of shoe or boot and they have enough stretch to be comfy, but not too tight and they do not bag out :)
4040	1	a	I am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute, durable, yet comfortable and not frumpy. these are definitely the ones i was looking for. the fit is great - not too tight and not too baggy. i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site. i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places - dressed up or down.
4041	1	a	36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottomsthis is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on, however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck, and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big, i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!
4042	1	a	"Was not sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3"", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they do not show the squishy bits at all. it a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i do not have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly"
4043	0	a	"I coveted this dress for so long, but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life. the ""gold"" patterns on top are not shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined, and they actually make a very strong impression up close (and are painted on, it seems). the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped. the coolest part about this dress, though, is the shiny, sequined black underlay. the photo does not do that component justice. i was s"
4044	1	a	Got for a mother day gift. think she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.
4045	1	a	Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i ca not resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print, it stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot, it pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on, the outer dress is sheer, the bodice is slightly fitted, with a fuller skirt that does not poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a
4046	1	a	This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big, especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night.
4047	1	a	Lovely dress, but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do.
4048	0	a	"Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5'6"" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la"
4049	0	a	I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child top. sad to return it!
4050	1	a	Love wearing these, i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter
4051	1	a	This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely, and i love the little longer sleeves.beautiful color too!
4052	1	a	"Ordered my usual size 28 in pilcro jeans but these are on the small side. fit is a little small in the waist area, & do not mean to be crude but the crotch area is on the short side for me. legs fit snug, & i have skinny legs! i'll have size up to a 29. the twisted seam look is really cute. 5'3"" abt 118# - too much ice cream lately."
4053	1	a	The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes.i will keep it because it gorgeous and i'll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it does not look on me like it does on the model.
4054	1	a	I was not sure about this dress, and decided to give it a shot based on reviews, could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length, and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest, but none of that is an issue.
4055	0	a	A very cute and comfy top that lightweight and falls nicely... but, it does snag very easily. so far, i've worn this top once and found small snags in multiple areas. the snags might blend into the fabric texture if they did not create dark spots. the yarn/thread is a mixture of a celadon tone and black, which concentrates the black when snagged.
4056	1	a	I generally do not spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips, buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then, size up.
4057	1	a	This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i do not
4058	1	a	"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!"
4059	1	a	These jeans are my new favorites! very flattering cut and color, and very high quality. i've worn them a ton since i got them, and they have not stretched out or lost their shape at all. only thing i would caution is that they run small... for reference, i wear a 26 in paige denim, a 27 in citizens, and 28 was perfect in these.
4060	1	a	"I did not think anything of this top online (i really do not care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
4061	0	a	"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it arrival this is going back."
4062	1	a	I just had to try it on because it was so soft! and i have never felt so comfortable and so sexy at the same time in a dress! i am 5'4 170lbs and 36ddd and the large fit well. i only with the slit came up higher. that might be an issue just because of my height though. loved it, waiting for a good sale!!
4063	1	a	Adorable romper. the only thing is the sleeves are a little shorter than portrayed in the picture. they come to about mid-forearm on me (and i'm a petite person). still cute but def not if you're looking for a full sleeve.
4064	1	a	I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50, even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish, and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri
4065	1	a	Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.
4066	1	a	I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.
4067	1	a	Pants fit great. true to size. did not stretch like some of the retailer pants that you need to buy in a smaller size. love that the calf is bigger than most of their pants which are usually too narrow for my bigger calves. very comfy look great with a white shirt and tie die is subtle. they will be a staple summer pair of pants.
4068	1	a	I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.
4069	1	a	This is a lovely top. received many compliments. felt very feminine, and perfect for chilly spring. please take this to the dry cleaners, you will avoid feeling distraught as i did after washing it, which is the recommended method to clean it, and seeing it shrunk to half it previous size. sad.
4070	0	a	I received these pants, but they are not as pictured, see the photo of the back pockets, there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received. i'm not sure about these, the quality is nice, but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered 2 sizes down.
4071	1	a	This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire), which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge, as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras, but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!
4072	1	a	"This dress is adorable. the material is thin and wrinkles easily but it is so flattering. the cut is a little flowy like typical off-the-shoulder dresses but this one is cut in at the waist so your figure is not swallowed up. it combines the sexy summer vibe of an off-the-shoulder look but flatters like a fit and flare dress. it is fairly short. while i am only 5'4"" in an xs it falls just a bit further up on my legs than the model pictured (makes no sense to me). the color is a rich coral pink a"
4073	1	a	"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple, but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it a beautiful, rich indigo color. it very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles, but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i have not worn and washed it yet, so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am"
4074	1	a	Light and distinctive design. the fabric seems somehow synthetic and in very warm weather might become not so fresh
4075	1	a	This shirt has beautiful colors in it. it goes with burgundy, grey, black, brown, blues, and denim. it a generous cut, and quite lightweight for fall layering.
4076	0	a	I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it was not worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
4077	1	a	This brand makes the best jackets. i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket. both fit amazing. this one is no different. it fits great!! love that it a great casual jacket with structure and drape. i ca not say enough good things about this jacket. every time i wear it, i feel so pulled together. fun light gray color that you do not see too often in jackets. this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come. must have.
4078	1	a	I love this blouse. it is perfect for a curvy figure. i think it runs true to size. maybe size up if you have a larger chest. i love how it is so feminine yet structured. the fabric is lovely, soft and structured all at once. love the knot, i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and could not leave the store without it. it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay $$$ for a perfect fit!
4079	1	a	"I was on the fence about this toposition because, as others have stated, it is quite billowy at the bottom. just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen v-neck cardi and it completely changed my mind!! wow! now i am not saying that this is not beautiful on its own, because.it truly is!! i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe. i did not order a petite even though i am 5'3"", and for that in am glad! i ordered regular size xs (108 lbs/36b)"
4080	1	a	Flattering to the figure. i'm bustier and slightly thicker waisted but this jumpsuit hugs and drapes in all the right places. normally i wear a medium petite but the regular small fit better (win!) i'm disappointed in the dye quality- my hands were blue from trying on the different sizes and i'm now on my second wash before wearing.
4081	1	a	Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.
4082	1	a	I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
4083	0	a	I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i did not even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
4084	1	a	"I bought this dress in gray in a size 4. i am usually a size 6, even an 8 in maeve, so i said this dress runs a tad large. it is soft and easy to wear--throw it on and go. i think it looks best with a belt but that my opinion. i am 5' 8.5"" tall, and this is a midi length on me. plenty long. not sure how it will wash. i think a fabric steamer will be needed. all in all, very pleased."
4085	1	a	These are very well constructed, medium weight, besutiful leggings.
4086	1	a	This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo. the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design. soft, flowing and flattering. definitely a keeper.
4087	1	a	"I am so glad that wide leg pants are coming back! i love this style - so flattering! the color on these (blue) is rich and unique and the fit is exactly what i was hoping for. i wanted them loose and low waisted and they are perfect. i am 5'4"" 122 lbs and ordered 27 petite. the length (listed at 30"") is spot-on with flats, no tailoring needed. i previously ordered these in white in 27 r. they also are good but a little too loose and will need hemming. def. recommend and hope retailer keeps this st"
4088	1	a	"I'm 5'8"" usually a size 2/xs and i bought this in a petite xs. never would i have imagined i'd want a petite size but i accidentally took it into the fitting room. the shorter length and less billowy effect is much more flattering. that said it still hit just below the knee and is very loose and flowing, but in a good way. :)"
4089	1	a	"Since i could not find this jacket in the store, i ordered it online, and received it today. i would say it runs true to size to me. for reference, i am 5'2"", 120lbs, and size small fits fine. the material is a little bit on the thin side, it is not as thick as a typical denim jacket. i also found the color of the buttons to be different from the online images. the online images showed that the buttons are bronze/golden color, but the one i received comes with gunmetal colored buttons. i do not k"
4090	1	a	I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt, or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops, although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium, and it fits perfect.
4091	1	a	I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went.
4092	0	a	I like the quality of material of this top but it too long and wide for my frame. the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders. too bad as i really wanted to love this.
4093	1	a	"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase."
4094	1	a	This was really cute and fit true to size. the only thing i did not love was the dip on the top left side of the tank near the cleavage. i probably should not have been surprised since it actually shows up in the picture on the model, but it does not lay flat correctly there like the right side. either way, it still very flattering and cute.
4095	1	a	I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i do not think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!
4096	1	a	I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but had not found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.
4097	1	a	This feels so nice and light and summery. nothing like a crisp white top for the season.
4098	1	a	Beautiful detail. sweater is warm, soft, and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile, but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.
4099	0	a	This is a very pretty dress. the previous reviewers helped a lot when it came to deciding which size to order. typically i am a 0 or 2, sometimes a 4. in this dress i ordered a 6. that was the perfect size. the coloring is cute, unique, and very versatile. for me it was not a keeper because the material was soooo heavy, feels like canvas almost. if you're looking for a dress to layer under a chunky sweater on a cold day i imagine this would work. but for me it was a no.
4100	0	a	"I love sweater dresses and was excited to find a dress that would be long enough for me to feel comfortable in. i am petite, but at my age i am not comfortable in things that fall more than an inch or two above my knee. this dress is much shorter than stated, and much shorter than it looks on the model. i measured the petite xxs (my normal size) and it is 31"" from the shoulder seam to the hem, not 36"" as stated. five inches is a big discrepancy. the color and style were lovely, but i just ca not"
4101	1	a	This is a beautiful skirt. it is exactly as pictured. the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected. i feel like it does run a bit small. i'm usually an 8 in skirts and dresses and bought a 10. it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now. my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement. anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away. the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well. i do
4102	1	a	"Ordered this dress online and hoped for the best, because there was not a size chart to reference. i'm usually in between a size small and a medium, i ordered the size small and it fit well. for a more flowy look i would have gone with the medium.everything about this dress is soft, i love it! even the ribbon is delicate, soft and made of quality material. the lining feels like heaven. this dress goes to the floor on me - i'm 5' 7"" - i was expecting it to be more mid ankle length, but i sti"
4103	1	a	"This dress is not form fitting and some might consider it a little ""shapeless"". however, the color is stunning, the quality is great, and its a great dress for a wedding where you want to stand out but not have to worry about anything too constricting. great for dancing the night away - the under layer and frill at the bottom are perfect. i am very pleased with this purchase!"
4104	1	a	I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room, and tried it on on impulse. i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric, and even more impressed with the price. i usually like my tops very fitted, and found this one hung loose, but not boxy. i have been wearing it quite a bit, sometimes with a camisole underneath, and sometimes not. i bought the one with the flowers, and it is not see-through, and the light fabric is good for our warm heat. i bought my usual s
4105	1	a	I love everything about this dress. the style, fit, colors and design of fabric, quality and feel of fabric. so happy and highly recommend!
4106	0	a	I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
4107	1	a	I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.
4108	0	a	"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress did not cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough, just did not flow very well."
4109	1	a	I love the style and quality of this skirt. the material is a bit heavier than anticipated, so it works well in cooler months, and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath. it fits true to size - my usual 6 is form-fitting without being overly snug or pulled.i am on the taller side, and the skirt is fairly long - it comes to the bottom of my knee.
4110	1	a	Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.
4111	0	a	I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they were not exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!
4112	1	a	I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck is not too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more
4113	1	a	So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small, did not come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine, has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item did not work for me :-(
4114	1	a	"The dress is very pretty, however the description is deceiving. i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as ""silk"" but that is not exactly true. the under-slip is silk but the outer dress, what you see is definitely not. it is a cheap, thin material on top, skirt is stiff,, not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think. i will keep it, very happy i did not pay full price."
4115	1	a	I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that just conjecture.
4116	1	a	I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt.
4117	1	a	This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove.
4118	0	a	This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it did not help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it getting r
4119	1	a	This is a great skirt. i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate. this skirt is really flattering on my body. the only thing that a little off is the tie at the front but it still really stunning on.
4120	0	a	Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i could not get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i do not understand why so constricting in the arms. i do not have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. ca not recommend. i'd pass on this one.
4121	1	a	This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.
4122	1	a	Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.
4123	1	a	Probably should have noticed the material this jumpsuit is made of before buying. tencel, thus little to no give,kind of like linen and silk. beautiful material, soft with a slight sheen. the top portion fits well and the triangles cover the girls well (36dd). unfortunately there is no give on the back end for my bottom which is quite round and its tight around my thighs which are not small either. (l/xl and 14). and sadly an xl would be too big upstairs and baggy around the middle. sigh, oh well
4124	1	a	This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.
4125	1	a	The shirt can be a little boxy, so make sure to order your size! the peplum is a great length in the back.
4126	1	a	"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up."
4127	1	a	I love ag jeans. these jeans fit snug but not confining. they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease. i love the way they fit my body with one exception. unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about 3 to 4 inches too long on my 5'3 frame. the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday (yay). i am 5'3 102lbs and even though i will have to hem them, the overall fit was great!
4128	1	a	Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26 on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!
4129	1	a	I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small, and while it a tight fit for me currently it still worked.
4130	1	a	I ordered this and did not even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just was not what i was looking for as far as color. also, the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well, thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a
4131	1	a	"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!"
4132	1	a	I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
4133	1	a	I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i wo not i'll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage.
4134	1	a	I love the unusual print, but the cut did not work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!
4135	1	a	These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.
4136	1	a	36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottomsthis tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that does not cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh
4137	1	a	Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also, 100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny, you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.
4138	1	a	Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands, have worn them when flying, etc. ca not say enough good things about these pants. they wash well, no ironing needed.
4139	1	a	In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area. however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!
4140	1	a	"Material is slightly thin- good transitional dress for spring or fall. the waist is not quite as fitted as i would like, but the neck and sleeves are perfect. the length is good, but i am short 5'1"" and 105 lbs- xs fit pretty well. a really good purchase- more of a workhorse work dress, and not a wow dress on me, but nice to pair with blazers, jewelry. do not regret the purchase. very comfortable. got compliments when i wore."
4141	1	a	"This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i'm a tall girl (5' 11"") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest."
4142	1	a	The top is so soft, and the lace detail in the backs makes this your no-so-average chambray top. the fit is flattering for a curvy figure.
4143	1	a	Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top, something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece does not disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.
4144	1	a	I love my blue dress, i'm a pear shape to the top fit fine on me. i know reviewers complained that the top was too tight, not so on me. it was also not sheer on me because it has a cotton lining underneath. got a lot of compliments!
4145	1	a	"I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift -- both in green, which is really a beautiful dark teal color (as pictured). the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted ""an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric."" :) the shirt is long enough, loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked, as pictured, but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt. i am usually an xs or an s in tops, and i ordered the s in this one. the larger size gives the slightly loose fit"
4146	1	a	"It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants, and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet, so i ca not comment on durability, but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear, and these pants are very flattering and slimming, and do not pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly, and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost"
4147	1	a	"Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm 5'5"" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t"
4148	1	a	I got size 26 and they do not fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.
4149	1	a	These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
4150	0	a	"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just does not look nice:( returned an xs and small."
4151	1	a	I really like the skirt! it very comfortable and i can wear it with so many colors.
4152	1	a	Beautiful colors. lovely style. feminine and has a nice flow. fiattering fit in back also. nice holiday blouse. really very pretty.
4153	1	a	Comfy and different. almost like a sweater fabric.
4154	1	a	This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size.
4155	1	a	Very cute. love the animals on it, especially the bunnies! however not sure about fit. fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down; it seems to billow/puff/bag in lower part, not at bottom but in the stomach area, like there is too much fabric. so it fits, but also looks like there something slightly off. interested in hearing other opinions about this. also i am slightly und 5 ft. there'no petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok.
4156	0	a	Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit, i did not think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
4157	1	a	"Works great on my 5'11"" frame. is pretty and feminine. great with skinny jeans and booties!"
4158	1	a	The weave is very loose and chunky which i like but is not so apparent in the picture. also the sleeves bell more than it looks like on the model. the color is a great caramel and it fit tts. i think it will be great on cooler days.
4159	1	a	"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me."
4160	1	a	"I tried it on and it fit like a glove. i'm only 5'2"" and i can wear with heals or flats. great built in bra. i'm a c cup and i've got a bubble butt. very flattering on my figure. quality worth every penny. many compliments. work appropriate or a luncheon! my fav retailer purchase by far."
4161	1	a	These jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding. would have perferred colorful embroiding though. they are boyfriend cut, but not slouchy. just a bit loose even around athletic legs. they run true to size, but have a lot of give. after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit. if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size.
4162	1	a	Material and color is nice. the leg opening is very large. i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle. with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look. if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.
4163	1	a	"I bought this dress for an all white event. i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out! it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better. i am 5'8"" and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s. you must steam out creases before wearing."
4164	1	a	Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much!
4165	1	a	This is probably my current favorite dress. it is beautiful, comfortable, and flattering. i wear it with swept up hair and delicate earnings.
4166	1	a	I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.
4167	1	a	Love these! i'm about 5'4, and they fit right at the ankle. the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans. i've worn them several times, and they have not stretched out at all. perfect for spring.
4168	1	a	"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful, comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty, the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket, but i digress. the"
4169	1	a	Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it thin, but not see through, so it lays well.
4170	1	a	"I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8"" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)"
4171	1	a	Love this skirt. super soft and flowy. the red color is beautiful. i love the detailed raunching for the waist band. the length is perfect at my knee is i wear it empire waist style or below my knees if i wear on my hips.
4172	1	a	I love this shirt for a throw on and go. hangs nicely and fits great. colors are more vibrant in person. i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!
4173	1	a	"I absolutely love this top, i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple, yet unique and cool. i'm 5'7"" 170 lb.s curvy/athletic and i got this in a medium, it fits perfectly and looks really great on! i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem... wish it came in more colors!"
4174	1	a	I like to wear swing tops because they are comfortable, not confining. this is definitely true for this top- i have an xs and it is quite spacious and boxy shaped. this is a simple cotton shirt but the ruffle adds a nice detail, and without being too much ruffle either. great to throw on with jeans!
4175	1	a	Love this sweater. i have it in both colors. it lightweight - a nice late summer/early fall option. the sleeves are really long which i love. because it a loose knit, it will snag somewhat easily, so be a little careful
4176	1	a	This sweater is actually so cute on, i had no idea, nut decided to try it on, since it was on sale. what a msitake, i had to actually buy it!the grey part is very soft and warm, the design part is nice andflattering. nothing wrong with this sweeater!note: i a,m petite (5 foot 1.5 inches) and decided to buy the regular size for longer length...
4177	0	a	This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it difficu
4178	0	a	Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful, it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
4179	1	a	Ordered the navy and aqua in medium. the aqua fit a lot tighter than the navy seemed to be a different fabric and less stretchy. loved the color on both but returning the the aqua. normally wear size 6
4180	1	a	The regular length i tried on in store definitely did not work for me. for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40.
4181	1	a	This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and does not require a lot of styling.
4182	1	a	So cute and a must have. took my normal p6 and fits perfect! love it
4183	1	a	I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c
4184	1	a	I love this dress - the fabric is super soft, and it falls beautifully! wish it was lined, but it a keeper. it does run big - i'm always a solid medium, and i had to go down to a small for this one (but who complaining!). the burgundy color is gorgeous! i'm 5'4 150 lbs, a size 8 (m) almost always.
4185	1	a	The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style is not for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it did not work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
4186	1	a	These are such fun pants. it a heavier denim without being so stiff. they run tts. i got my usual size 26 & they fit comfortably. i have not washed them yet but once i do i typically wash in cold gentle cycle & hang dry.
4187	1	a	Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but did not realize it not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos, there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they do not show. other than that, it a beautiful, unique summer top.
4188	1	a	This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual, t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely, and it very feminine. i got the light blue color, and ca not wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!
4189	1	a	"I tried on this dress in the portland, me, store today. so much good to say about it: the wine color is deep and rich, the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk, the cut of the dress so flattering.but, i did not get it. i am 5'2"" and weigh 135 lbs. i can sometimes wear a medium, but my upper arms and hips can require a large, usually petite for proper length. the store did not have a large (i did not even realize the dress also came in petite), so i tried on a medium. nice fit through the"
4190	1	a	Really cute and comfortable. i can wear it to work for a casual friday, or out on the weekend. a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer!
4191	1	a	I liked the color of this top but i did not really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
4192	1	a	I bought one of these in store and then ordered two more online! i love this top. it loose and hangs just right. i have gotten so many compliments on it. very comfy and cute. pockets too, which is always a plus.
4193	1	a	Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed, even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter.
4194	0	a	This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
4195	1	a	This dress is really cute, but it runs quite large. order a size smaller! i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to. it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles.
4196	0	a	I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes
4197	1	a	I usually wear a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised the xs fit better than the s. very pretty, really perfect color for fall. i like that it not tight or constricting so you can wear it for every day and not feel like it difficult to move around. the longer length is nice too for. bonus that it not dry clean only. my only problem with this dress is it all polyester, which is just cheap fabric. if it was not for that, i'd give it 5 stars.
4198	1	a	Very cute and comfortable!does run big, i used the size chart and it very generous-would order down a size next time.
4199	1	a	"The neckline is beautiful, whether pulled forward or slipping back. the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias. raglan sleeves with high armholes. it is a tiny bit itchy, and normally i'm not too sensitive, but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similar..fit for size xs on 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 (30d or 32c bra) with narrow shoulders and torso:snug at the shoulders, but as it is a pure merino knit, it does stretch. the front length just"
4200	1	a	I loved this top on the mannequin, so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10, i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..
4201	1	a	"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5""."
4202	0	a	This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. do not get.
4203	0	a	I never write reviews
4204	1	a	Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i was not sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.
4205	1	a	"Super cute. 5'9"" 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much."
4206	1	a	I got size 2p. it comes down a little over my knee cap and i wish it was rather a little above it. i have a small chest about 32b and with a padded push up bra it was still bit loose on the top. i do have a shorter torso. i feel like i could've gone with the 0 petite. i'm a pear shape and more like a size 4 on the bottom and i weigh about 115lbs- there is tons of room to go smaller - it is not form fitting on the bottom at all. has that slight polyester feel but the fabric is beautiful and thick
4207	1	a	This is a gorgeous dress. the fabric has the look of linen (though it is not) and the lining is a soft mesh. looks both relaxed and stylish.
4208	0	a	This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
4209	1	a	I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!
4210	1	a	Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.
4211	1	a	This dress is absolutely stunning! the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor. it runs very small, i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress, i normally wear size 10. i had to return it and order again in size large. i love the fit this time!! but be aware if your normal size is higher than 10 this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress. it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion
4212	1	a	I absolutely love this dress. i feel it the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!
4213	1	a	This dress has great details and fit well on my hourglass shape. it just felt too covered up at the arms/shoulders, though. if the sleeves had been shorter or it had been sleeveless i think it would have felt a little more modern. the waistband on the one i tried on was also twisted, so you might want to check that before you buy. fit is tts. a little on the short side.
4214	0	a	"But like other reviewers said, it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs, i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material, it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this, but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed, because the material is beautiful and i lo"
4215	1	a	Soft. fitted without being tight. flattering neckline. nice embroidery.
4216	1	a	I was a little apprehensive about getting this dress without any reviews, but i am really glad i did. first, it looks exactly as pictured, maybe even more beautiful. the material is nice and flowing, and very light, so it going to make a fantastic summer dress. there are two layers- an under layer which can be completely detached from the pink silk top layer. the reason why i say true to size is that even though the pink silk layer is pretty loose, the bottom layer conforms more your body. i'
4217	1	a	"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s"
4218	1	a	Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
4219	1	a	I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.
4220	1	a	"This is a thick jacquard fabric and the colors are stunning. this would be best for very thin petties or tall women. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 27/4, and it was just too much fabric so my waist looked thick. the length was great though. sad it did not work out"
4221	1	a	This picture does not do the skirt justice. i paired it with a creme colored cashmere cowlneck sweater and a silver jeweled belt. it is really pretty and flattering on.
4222	1	a	I am usually an xsp or 0p but i ordered up one size (2p) due to previous reviews complaining about the tight slip. however i definitely did not need to size up. the slip is fine and the outer hell' is billowy and i should have stuck with my usual size! when i put it on i was not in love due to the dress being so roomy, but a second check in the mirror showed that the fabric / seams draped well and it overall looked pretty cute. it hits about 2 inches above my knees and therefore seems pretty p
4223	1	a	This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined, so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line, not sheath, but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest, so if you're between sizes in the bust, i'd order up. that said, a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4, 120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
4224	1	a	I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i ca not wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
4225	1	a	The pictures do not do this dress justice. this dress is gorgeous, the color is beautiful, and it is so flattering on. even better, this dress is machine washable! simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners. i love this dress so much i do not even mind that i purchased it at full price, and now it is on sale. buy this dress for a special occasion -- it is so special.
4226	1	a	"These are a great dark wash and they fit true to size to every other stevies i own. for reference i am 5'6"", 145lbs, size 6/m and the 29 fit perfect. they are a bit long but i fold them up and it looks just as cute. i highly recommend especially since they are on sale, definitely a closet staple."
4227	0	a	This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.
4228	0	a	Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo
4229	0	a	I have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version, but it just did not work nearly as well. the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra. the black pattern was also nothing special. i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel - would consider getting it if it went on sale. i tried on the small and the extra small - did not notice a difference between the two. i think i have on the xs in the photo.
4230	0	a	I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just did not fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
4231	1	a	It was a little shorter than i expected i am 5'8 and 125 pounds. i ordered the extra small and it was a perfect fit aside from length. at 42 yrs old, i ca not wear mid thigh dresses to work. hit hit me at the same length it hit the model in the picture.... even though she is 5'10. if you are 5'6 and below this is a beautiful dress
4232	1	a	Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white, because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe.
4233	1	a	This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and could not be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise, i'm thrilled.
4234	1	a	I am a huge pilcro fan. however, these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
4235	1	a	"I own quite a few deletta tops, and this one nails it. a great staple in a pretty color (i purchased the green). peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much. this one is so flattering. i initially ordered a medium (5'8"", 145) but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me. the small is perfect. the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted, nipping in at the waist. the ""skirt"" piece falls nicely and is l"
4236	1	a	I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island. it was comfortable and appropriate. i received so many compliments from strangers. wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too!
4237	0	a	This top is very nice. good quality, good design. it just does not fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top, especially around my shoulders, while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured, perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
4238	1	a	First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just could not get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret
4239	1	a	Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.
4240	1	a	Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!
4241	0	a	"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it is not. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma table runner."
4242	1	a	Love it! perfect casual look with a jacket and booties
4243	1	a	I really wanted to love this dress but unfortunately the length of the ruffle up top is not flattering on someone with a large chest. if you are d or smaller, it will probably be perfect. great material, color, and feel. so bummed i had to return it
4244	1	a	This product is amazing. i love that it comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it very versatile and i love it.
4245	1	a	Rec'd so many compliments on this. absolutely beautiful, comfortable and versatile. try it with white crops and cute heels!
4246	1	a	Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.
4247	1	a	This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!
4248	1	a	Gorgeous and well constructed dress. runs a little small. could not button up the size 8 although i can fit into a size 6 of other dresses by this designer. also the back buttons are very difficult to button, especially by yourself. i had to return it but am contemplating ordering it in a size 10.
4249	1	a	Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better. one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way! they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what the same? still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar. i h
4250	1	a	Wow great soft feels great but not too clingy. only thing keeping from 5 start is that it will pill some. the sleeves are not fuzzy so they do not pill but body will/does.
4251	0	a	"Despite retailer claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat, beware. they have not. i ordered this coat november 18th, feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed, because retailer indicated ""rest assured, this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle, i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di"
4252	1	a	This was my first mother denim purchase and i've already gotten another color. love the feel of this denim. it heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight (not stretch out) while being comfortable. this color is perfect too. so flattering. love!!
4253	1	a	This sweater is really lovely. it does not look like it does in the picture. i got the xsmall as i was worried it would run big. it much shorter than i though, fits more like a petite size. the sleeves are 3/4 length, which i was not thrill with but accepted. the color combo is really lovely! it very comfortable and well made and it was perfect for work but lovely with a pair of jeans too!
4254	1	a	This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors, fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site. .i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage, not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support, and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w
4255	1	a	I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!
4256	1	a	Like the other reviewer said, there a nice inner lining, and the material of the jacket is just so nice. looks a little like a blazer when worn, but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece.
4257	1	a	This top is adorable. i love it! i could not figure out which way to wear it so i just wear it both ways.the tag is on the side, which allows you to wear it either way. it does run big! i normally wear a medium and i could have used a small, but kept the medium because i like very loose clothing.
4258	1	a	"This dress is my new favorite! the style is trendy and feminine while forgiving in the tummy area without looking maternity or too baggy. it is so versatile because it can be dressed up or down and it a great transitional dress b/c once it cools down, it will look great with a denim jacket, cardi, booties, etc. i normally wear a m, sometimes a l (i'm 5'7"", 36dd) but the m fits great. the slip is a little snug across the chest but i definitely could not size up b/c then the dress would be too bi"
4259	1	a	"I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and does not show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!"
4260	1	a	This top is the perfect staple! the fabric is soft and comfortable. i generally wear medium tops, but the small fits perfectly. took the chance ordering online and i am very happy!
4261	0	a	I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
4262	1	a	I love the muted coloring! this top is generously sized. i have a small bust and it is roomy under the arms. i wish it was less full around the waist area.
4263	1	a	These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.
4264	1	a	I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!
4265	1	a	This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy, which i love. the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft! ca not wait to wear it with a t-shirt and jeans!
4266	1	a	Love this sweater! not too long or bulky,true to size. the fabric is super soft, great quality!
4267	1	a	I really love this top. it cute, whimsical, and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it, especially during the tag sale.
4268	1	a	The previous review was right: this jacket/coat feels and looks expensive. nice weight, very soft. pattern is better in person. i normally always wear a l and in this, i ca not decide between the s or m.
4269	1	a	I have been wanting this skirt for a long time. i was worried about waist which is fitted. i finally ordered it and it i very cute. the waist is indeed fitted but there is some give to the fabric, fabric is soft cotton not unlike denim with some stretch. there i a soft cotton liner in skirt. i took the cloth belt off because i cannot retie it so neatly as in the photo, also i just do not want a bow on my stomach. i own a cute narrow belt that i will wear with skirt as i think something is needed
4270	0	a	"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately, it disappointed all around. it way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend."
4271	0	a	I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress did not move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt did not enhance the
4272	1	a	"The craftmanship & material (not itchy at all to me) are exquisite for this unique sweater/coat, but the shape is not for me. i have a slender build, 5'8"" 130 lbs, 34 b chest (i oredered my usual sm, which fit), and the silouette of this piece looked ridiculous on me. when buttoned, the top half was nicely fitted-- not snug; however, the lower half ballooned out to overemphasize the hips due to the pleating in back. the thing is, i have no hips, and having hips is a very good thing, though not i"
4273	1	a	I love this dress, but it is inches shorter than the description says or shows. i am only 5'7 and it is 2 to 3 inches above my knee. otherwise, it is a loose fit and hides all problem areas.
4274	1	a	This is a great sweater/poncho. is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath. great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans.
4275	0	a	It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.
4276	1	a	"As soon as i opened the package, i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5"" and 128lb, ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3"
4277	0	a	I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just was not feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it was not for me.
4278	0	a	I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it unwearable now. so disappointing.
4279	1	a	I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it difficult to find dresses that do not like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect
4280	1	a	Comfortable and flattering for all body types...good for both day and evening...
4281	1	a	My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i ca not take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it very versatile.
4282	1	a	Dress is lovely - the sleeves were shorter than i thought but otherwise nice fabric and very pretty cut!!
4283	1	a	I ordered the medium pink in a size small. the color is more of a hot pink. it runs small through the shoulders and bust (i'm 34-d). i like that it covers your bum and the detail down the back. but it is going back, i may try a medium petite in a different color.
4284	1	a	"Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2"" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it a classic! you will smile!"
4285	1	a	Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties.
4286	1	a	This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!
4287	1	a	I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.
4288	1	a	This sweater carries alot of weight, more than it appeared. the yellow is more of a bright green/yellow- not a soft color as pictured. it is still a nice layering piece.
4289	1	a	I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it flattering for my curvy figure.
4290	1	a	This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller
4291	1	a	I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on, i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts.
4292	1	a	I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10, the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.
4293	1	a	Love everything about this dress! it true to size , flows nicely, great quality. it just amazing.
4294	1	a	Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag outafter wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are moredressy than a regular legging.
4295	1	a	Super comfortable; great with jeans or leggings. i would definitely order a size down.
4296	0	a	Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!
4297	1	a	Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-)
4298	1	a	"This top is gorgeous. i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style. ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order. it is cropped. i am 5'3"" and it hit me as pictured on model. if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you"
4299	1	a	"Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it a top that comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it a cotton tee and i did not want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!"
4300	1	a	I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil
4301	1	a	"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap, flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting, the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim, and ordered petite small, and it a little longer on me than it is on the model. i do not mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it"
4302	1	a	This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it really comfortable and fun, too!
4303	1	a	This dress is so comfortable and so sexy. hugs your curves. probably would not look great on an athletic frame. i bought on sale and was a good price. i usually wear a 2 or 4 in retailer, and the xs fit fine. the small was much too baggy.
4304	1	a	I first bought this top in the dark grey, loved it so much that i ordered the navy too! the quality is amazing as always, and fit is perfect (some may say it runs large, but i'm pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit). i love the material of the lighter color blocked back. it so versatile and easy to throw on. i've worn it simply with jeans, and i've also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit (received compliments!).
4305	0	a	This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.
4306	1	a	This dress is very pretty. i love it! people are not kidding about the buttons! i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived. unfortunately, both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag. it was on sale so i'm guessing they were lost before shipping. i love the dress enough to keep it. it will not be that big of a deal to replace them. besides the buttons, the dress is a very nice quality. it is lined and has a nice weight to it. i'm obsessed with rifle paper co. so i
4307	1	a	I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it just a little roomy so it perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it wo not be too warm.
4308	1	a	"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on""."
4309	1	a	I bought this dress for my bridal shower. it beautiful, tts. i usually wear 2/4 in retailer and the small was perfect. i tried on in store and the dress had a few snags and defects. they ordered me one to be delivered to my apt and it was perfect. the back is pretty too!
4310	1	a	"I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it consistent for tiny, which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway, the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top, and if that snap pops open it open all the way down to the waist area where"
4311	1	a	Do not try this on, if you do not plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.
4312	0	a	I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.
4313	1	a	This is a lovely, romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said, the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size 4 and 6 for me to try. when i got there, i finally settled on a size 2, so it runs a bit large. i have a 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style, give it a try, you wo not be disappointed.
4314	1	a	I ordered the xxs, i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude), and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering, the cowl neck is pretty, the sleeves are shorter, and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies, if you have leaner legs.(for reference, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs)
4315	1	a	I could not wait to try this on because i love the brand holding horses! this dress did not disappoint! although i detest the difficulty with side zippers (why ca not they simply return to the back seam?) i was easily able to pull this dress on because it had some give to the fabric. once on, the dress has a very flattering fit over the bust (the wrap over bodice is already secured with a stitch) and through the tummy. i believe these were sized s,m, l so i took my regular medium.length wise, par
4316	1	a	I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it very comfortable and stylish.
4317	1	a	Beautiful sweater, unique knit mix and i love the color, but the fabric is too itchy. i was wearing a long sleeve dress underneath but the yarn was prickling my arms, bum and thighs. colorblock patchwork arrangement made me look extra top hefty and emphasized my trouble spots (upper back/arms). i ordered lp but it was too large so would recommend staying tts.
4318	1	a	This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
4319	1	a	"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i did not want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!"
4320	1	a	Since the reviews are quite polarized for this dress, i thought i'd throw in my $0.02...first, to clarify, there is indeed a zipper. it well-hidden under the l arm (i did not think there was one based on the reviews and got it on zipped fine; once it was on, i could feel the zipper [not uncomfortably, i just realized there was one]). dress does not have a lot of give, so i imagine that zipped, it would be difficult to get off. because no give, do not order down; that said, i found this dress to
4321	1	a	This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which does not happen often. a size 8 worked for me, ca not wait to wear this!
4322	1	a	"For a special occasion, but i did not keep mine:i ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort color is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more 'red""fastening is a little more complicated, though you do not have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.but: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is"
4323	1	a	Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size, unique in design, versatile, soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work, date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!
4324	1	a	This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it did not fall off.the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.
4325	1	a	"This dress was love at first sight. i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool. as another reviewer said, it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am 5'2"". it shrank about one inch in length only. i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful- that a plus! i was comfortable and cool all day. get it before it is out of stock. this dress will not make it to sale."
4326	1	a	These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.
4327	1	a	These joggers are amazing! they fit true to size if not a bit loose. i purchased my usual small (size 6). the seams are sewn perfectly and the fabric is dreamy. i wore these to work with sandals and was so comfy and appropriate all day in the hot weather. the color is a deep gray and goes with everything! the front panel makes them a bit more fitted and there is even back pockets!
4328	1	a	Great, easy to wear wrap dress. rich colors are fabulous for fall. the contrasting knit back adds just the right touch to make the dress more interesting as compared to your typical paisley print dress. i ended up with a petite as the length seemed more flattering and the bust line fit better than the regular.
4329	0	a	I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.
4330	1	a	"Got these on sale...absolutely love eberjey! fabric is super soft and easy to wash. more ""normal"" than other eberjey styles (not lingerie). i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs and small fit well. i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but does not make it fit weird at all. highly recommend!"
4331	1	a	Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long.
4332	0	a	I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
4333	1	a	"I'm a big fan of the ""idea of"" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10"", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2"" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!"
4334	1	a	I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.
4335	1	a	I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i did not want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any
4336	1	a	"This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it wide across, and does not ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear"
4337	1	a	"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them)."
4338	1	a	I have 2 of these now by the same designer. it comfortable and will be a staple in my closet for summer, early fall and spring. it is a little on the long end but with platform heels, it perfect.
4339	1	a	I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion. it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise. i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a
4340	1	a	"Glad i went in to buy this: in store i was surprised by the texture which was much more cotton (almost gauze-like) than most cloth & stone shirts made with tencel. the blue looks like demin online but in person is a rather ugly dark blue, the pink was almost red, but the yellow was beautiful!it is double-lined which is one of the best things about it. i'm usually between a s and m and could have gone either way but choose m because it was a little longer and ""flowy-er""."
4341	1	a	"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it a little longer on me, it great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you ca not see the color in the photo, but there a sea green lining which is a cute touch!"
4342	1	a	I really like these pants - great color and design. they are even lined! unfortunately, they do not work on my curvy frame - all the usual problems: waist too large, hips too small. sadly, i am taking them back.
4343	1	a	I have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it. the silk is luxurious and looks expensive. when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty. typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy. but this one is the exception. i think the super long length (although problematic) as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric, as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar
4344	1	a	I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it soft and has a very flattering n
4345	0	a	I agree with the other reviewers. i ordered 2 of these but had to return both because the zippers did not work. when i returned them, the saleslady said many people had problems with them.
4346	0	a	This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and did not lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.
4347	1	a	This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!i would recommend this product
4348	1	a	This dress is cut perfectly to have a lot of movement. love the colors. i went with my usual size 2 and it fit generously. i am 5.4 and the size 2 hit about the same as the model. my only complaint: it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress.
4349	1	a	This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy.i think the only drawback is that the color is not as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.i'll be wearing this way into the fall!
4350	1	a	Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute
4351	1	a	I loved the swimsuit when i saw it online and it looks just a cool in person. however, i had to return it because the size large top was very very small. i wear a 34d bra. this top seemed like it would only work for an a or b cup size, even in the size large. cute suit for the right body, though!
4352	0	a	I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.
4353	1	a	"Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you do not really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i did not initially notice, but was not really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i could not wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it also a bit shorter than i th"
4354	1	a	I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design, the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs. they were not my size, but, to my surprise they could be ordered in my size, still at the sale price.the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them.
4355	0	a	"I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs, slender bone structure. the medium fit well in the front but hung to the back of knees in back...just way too long. it would work best on someone closer to 6' tall."
4356	1	a	I did not really pay this dress much attention online or even in store. an associate suggested i try it on. it so much cuter on than it appears online. the button detail is great and i love the pockets. it does bunch up a little but not too bad. i tried on my normal size 2 or 4 and the 4 fit me perfectly. it was a tad long and maybe the petite will be better. i have fairly sensitive skin and the wool pieces were a bit itchy so i had to take it back. but if you are not sensitive then this is for
4357	1	a	This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.
4358	1	a	I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high. as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and i'm glad i did. i'm usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception. i'm tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because it cut on the bias. it is a little low but i've been wearing it for parties. it might be too low for work depending on the setting. i do not usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty
4359	1	a	I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and do not show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very
4360	1	a	I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall, one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring, and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great, but the violet color does not quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person, the violet
4361	0	a	The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but, it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.
4362	0	a	This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
4363	1	a	"I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss. this one a definite hit:) i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap (unique, bohemian, feminine, cozy), the fabric (beautiful intricate weave, high quality knit, wearable virtually year-round thanks to air conditioning), how stylish it is (fringe, very ""in"" kimono cocoon cardigan), how much of my wardrobe it goes with (neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down, elegant or casual), and the fact that it has"
4364	1	a	The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing, you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.
4365	1	a	Love this tunic, it super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots
4366	1	a	Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not
4367	1	a	Seafolly is my favorite swim/beach brand. the quality is always great! this is a colorful sheer kaftan that will get much use this summer.
4368	1	a	I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!
4369	1	a	Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!
4370	1	a	Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!
4371	1	a	I recommend this product, but with the following reservations. the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper, but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes, which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
4372	1	a	Such a cute top! can be dressed up or down. i wore it on sting break and had many compliments.
4373	1	a	Beautiful top, i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it going back.
4374	1	a	"I have not gotten a dress from retailer in a long time that i like as i do this one! this is the old retailer-quality, extras, and unique design! fits like it was made for me-tts, i am 5'5"", 142 lbs and the 6 is perfection! no enlarged arm holes or funky fit...it has lining as well as a tu-tu slip underneath so you can create your own fullness in the skirt. it is very fitted at the bust and waist and will hide numerous flaws at the hips. this dress is spectacular so do not wait...press the button!!!!"
4375	1	a	This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.
4376	0	a	I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting 'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i do not care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go!
4377	1	a	I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i could not resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i did not think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it was not too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness.
4378	1	a	I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f
4379	1	a	This vest is cute. the colors are as pictured, and the lace detail on the back is adorable. it is summery and versatile. however, it was really big on me. i usually wear and xs, but it just swallowed me. now i have to consider whether to exchange for an xs petite.
4380	1	a	I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris.
4381	1	a	Love this shirt, but beware that it shrinks if you place it in the dryer. the good news is my teen daughter loves it, too, and benefited from my mistake. i usually wear a s or size 6 and bought this in a medium the second time around to allow for dryer.
4382	1	a	"I recently purchased the reading room cardigan in the color pink. the color is beautiful, and very flattering with my olive complexion. i ordered a medium, and although it not a traditional fitted cardigan, the shape was very flattering, good length for my 5' 6"" height, and is very versatile. great for transitional weather into spring."
4383	1	a	"I really liked this dress online and i loved it in person. the print is different, the waist is synched, skirt is full. has a very feminine shape. definitely a special piece. runs large. i'm usually a 6 in dresses and an 8 in skirts. i'm 5-5"" 136#s, 34c and then 6 was noticeably too big. size 4 fit perfect (and i'm no size 4). no sleeves will make if easy to add a denim jacket or a cardigan. it hits approx 3-4"" above the knees, but has a conservative high neckline and back is covered. good quali"
4384	1	a	Love this. can be a jacket or blazer syle. fits well.
4385	1	a	Beautiful shorts, good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you!
4386	1	a	Pilcro has my heart! their cut and style are perfect for me - no more squeezing into skinny jeans! dear retailer, please always sell pilcro and maeve brands - they are amazing!
4387	1	a	I purchased this in the cream/beige color and love that it will go with everything. i can add details with long necklace or scarf-even a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans. i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model. the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth. it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath. i purchased the xs, my usual size and fits great. 5'8-slender. love my purchase!
4388	1	a	Has it been 5 years already. i too bought this 5 years ago. it peels and does not close but the horses make up for that. very very warm.
4389	1	a	I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.
4390	1	a	It a cozy sweater that does not make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it not too heavy but still warm enough. it like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
4391	0	a	I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder), and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!
4392	1	a	I tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love it...too bad i do not need yet anothr black top. fit is loose/flowy, but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt. tried on regualr xs, i could proably go to petites though, but thankfully there is a button at the neck
4393	1	a	I have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it. it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up. super versatile!!
4394	1	a	So, i bought these in 31 --my regular size in hei-hei and they were huge. so, now i am not sure if i should go for a 30 or 29? i guess i will try the 30. they are really soft and very cute pants. just the sizing is difficult.
4395	1	a	Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts, lovely color and a staple classic.
4396	0	a	There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
4397	1	a	The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.
4398	1	a	Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress, but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite, also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit, but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
4399	1	a	I love tracy reese designs because they are so feminine and figure flattering. this dress almost hits the target, it just a bit off on the bodice, especially at the back and sides. the pleating balloons out too much. i'm sure a little tailoring will fix this, it up to the buyer if that worth the money to do it. for myself, i'm just wearing a thin cropped cardi to hide the billow. since petite was sold out, i took a regular size 8 which is the smaller of my size range. the length makes this
4400	1	a	"I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5"", 112# frame. my daughter loved it so she scored. i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms. can be dressy or casual."
4401	1	a	This is a cute dress, but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small, 2. it is super textured so if you do not want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame, this probably is not for you. it too bad it online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it probably adorable on smaller, thinner people. unfortunately, mine is going back.
4402	1	a	Bought this dress for my daughter (teenager) and it is perfect. it is a cute dress, perfect for summer parties, special occasions. it seems to run a little small and wrinkle easily, but over all, she and i both are happy with the dress.
4403	1	a	Beautiful dress! beautiful color and design. as the other reviewer says, it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that does not show in the picture, however, it adds to its style and beauty! i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally!
4404	0	a	"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i did not like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned."
4405	1	a	I could not agree more with that first review. i would add that it does run large.the leg holes are big. beautiful flower watercolor design as it shows in the picture. soft fabric and thin elastic waist band. no fake string tightener or buttons. simple and romantic. yet still a good sleep short to prance around the house in:)
4406	1	a	I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.
4407	0	a	I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day, but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere, so i had to return it.
4408	1	a	If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.
4409	1	a	I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i did not require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
4410	1	a	"I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it ""holds"" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!"
4411	0	a	This is a beautiful skirt; the colors are fresh and summery, yet subtle, and it a nice sturdy cotton, not flimsy and cheap looking. however, i agree with the reviewer who said that this runs small. i take a 4 in most skirts, but i had to try on a 6 and still felt that it did not fit quite right. if you're extremely thin, this might be great for you.
4412	1	a	"I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol), and was nervous that the neck would be tight, based on the other reviews. however, once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and did not create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7"", 36dd 135lbs.i would say this items runs true"
4413	1	a	Fit is tts and comfortable. the color did not suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it a beauty
4414	1	a	At first i did not like the way this skirt hung -- the fabric seemed stiff and it stuck out at the sides where the straight front seam meets the dipped back. but i ran it through a wash and dry, and it softened up and hangs much better! you have to love a polished looking skirt that you can launder with all your other clothes. i am also very pleased that although it looks bulky in the pictures here, it is not at all, and it does not wrinkle - perfect for traveling light. note also that the front pl
4415	1	a	Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.
4416	1	a	Fits perfect.
4417	1	a	Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.
4418	1	a	Pleasantly surprised with how cute and flattering this dress is. i'm about a size 12 and the size l fit perfectly. the bit of a line to the skirt is very flattering. and the knit is not too clingy.
4419	0	a	The skirt is not as form fitting as i had hoped. it is a lot of material that is flowy and billowy, not straight and pencil-like as shown as in the pictures. the material and design is just okay- not super wowed by it. i did size down but feel like i might need to size down even more to get more of a fitted look.
4420	1	a	Wonderful dress! very comfortable and great fit! received numerous compliments whenever i wear it.
4421	1	a	I love these pants. i have them in the black and green. they are comfortable and look great on my curvy figure. i am 5'2 120lbs and got the size 27
4422	1	a	"Bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different. it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have it in an xs and a s and have not yet decided which i am keeping as they both work. i'm 5'4"" and 116#. going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall. i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well. have i mentioned i love this dress?"
4423	1	a	This skirt is the perfect flirty denim piece for the summer. it light weight but good quality. the only draw back is the waist is quite fitted when zipped. had to size up. it like a pencil skirt on top, which does make it tough to tuck anything in unless it very thin. overall, charming skirt. do love.
4424	1	a	"I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11"" and slim and the top hung nicely on me."
4425	1	a	I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit. it a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso. for reference, i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top. i went with the medium based on other reviews. i i was lucky to find this on sale.
4426	0	a	I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
4427	0	a	So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it really god awful.
4428	0	a	This immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern, and the fabric is actually quite nice. the fit is at least a size or two too large though, with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down. my normal 4 was big everywhere, and the 2 was still big in the chest, but fit everywhere else. the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas, but the top section just did not work for me. maybe better for someone better endowed?
4429	1	a	I am in love with this dress. the colors are amazing but also is the fabric. it is soft and supple. i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust, waist, and hips. this is truly an amazing dress. you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look.
4430	1	a	"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3"" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace."
4431	1	a	This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i could not even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s
4432	1	a	Love this top! it has a great retro vibe, and the colors are great. it is very soft and great quality! i was in between a size xs and small. i went with the small, and wish i had gone with the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!
4433	1	a	I love the colors, and saw the xxs p in a store, so tried it on, but sadly, that was still a lot of fabric on me. i think if you have very small thin arms, that may work, but with muscles, it just made me look bigger than i am... the design (pattern) is really nice though. 115 lbs, 30 dd flat
4434	1	a	"This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7"" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and"
4435	1	a	Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric. looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans, pants or long dresses. i'm 5'1 and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great, not too long so i wo not have to shorten.
4436	1	a	This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm't work for me. but if you do not mind layering or your bra peeking through, it still a very beautiful dress. i'm usually a petite in most things but this was not available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long, not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on
4437	0	a	This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it does not drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
4438	1	a	Love this top. bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment! it is very flattering to my shape. have a bit of a pooch, and ca not even tell. looks great with skinny jeans. look forward to wearing many more times
4439	1	a	"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,"
4440	1	a	This is one of my new favorite dresses!! i ordered this in pink, and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model. it more of a reddish color. the dress hugs my body in a flattering way. i'm a 34b and the dress fits very comfortably, but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust. i'm usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove. it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant. i ca not wait to wear this out!!
4441	1	a	Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though
4442	1	a	"These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since it not ""hemmed"" to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!"
4443	1	a	Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...
4444	1	a	"I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment)."
4445	1	a	This is a great everyday top that is very versatile.
4446	1	a	"I bought these pants in yellow for an event where i had to wear yellow. i was weary about the color but it is so great in person. it a very bright lemon-y yellow. they're high waisted and very flattering. i'm 5'11"" and normally wear a 30 and they were a little too large but nothing a tight belt could not fix. they also hit a little bit above the ankle which initially i was worried about with the flare but it actually was a really cool look. i received so many compliments that day and am glad to"
4447	1	a	I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately (the green motif). as others noted, it is on the flowly side. for this reason, i went with a size s. i wore it on easter and ca not wait to wear it again. i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress. it is a simple over the head, no fuss kind of dress. you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess. this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years
4448	1	a	This shirt looked so perfect on the model, and i was so excited to get it! when i received it, it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is, it too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me, but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.
4449	0	a	"I really did not expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8"" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly did not even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue, which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss."
4450	1	a	I'm glad i saw this item in stores, otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp, and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!
4451	1	a	Nicely structured, yet soft blazer. wardrobe staple. runs true to size. i would buy all colors, but restrained myself to the black/green.
4452	0	a	This dress is pretty, but there were a few things i disliked.the overdress is fairly shapeless; however, the slip is fitted and well above the knee. since the overdress is sheer, the shortness of the slip is visible the fabric of the overdress felt rough on my skin. i did like the contrast of textures between the overdress, the slip, and the lace. finally, as other reviewers have shared, the buttons are not functional, and the v-neck of the overdress is deep. i recommend trying the dress
4453	1	a	Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i've been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves.
4454	1	a	The perfect flowy fall top! the material is thin so it may pick a little, but i love it.
4455	1	a	The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress, you become drawn to it. then, as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery, and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny, set buttons, you soon realize, that not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft, delicate, chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was
4456	1	a	Was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape (i am 5', probably 135-140lb; one to two sizes larger on the bottom) when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online. you can never tell with these flare dresses - some just make the hips look so much worse and have not had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season. first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly - was looking a little big but thought orde
4457	0	a	"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist."
4458	1	a	I really love this dress and want to buy it, but i wo not buy it in white. it is just too easy to get dirty. i would love a pretty blue or even a darker yellow.
4459	1	a	A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.the fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it not really baggy.really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.
4460	0	a	I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it so flimsy and sheer it probably should not be worn in public. there a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately does not do much. pass, ladies.
4461	1	a	These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!
4462	1	a	I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it worth the price. great colors though.
4463	1	a	I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.
4464	1	a	I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.
4465	1	a	I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
4466	0	a	The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
4467	1	a	This one is way better in person. admittedly, i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well, it is great. a little sheer, adn super static-y when i received it, but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking, but this doe' nott come in petites,so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too, neutral, event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish, it stil lcan be worn with anything..
4468	1	a	These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!
4469	1	a	"I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it, however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever, though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me, and i do not think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky, which it does mention. maybe a little expensive, but i did use a coupon."
4470	1	a	These are super comfortable. i love feeling like i'm wearing pajamas in public but being properly dressed, although i wear them around the house often, too. i do not regret spending this much money on these pants, it was worth it since i'm wearing them so much.
4471	1	a	I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.
4472	1	a	I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest, but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip, but ultimately decided to return it.
4473	1	a	Perfect sweater to throw on with anything. it is fairly thin, i wore a cami underneath. the sleeves and hem are rolled. you have to be careful and it can snag easily. happy with my purchase.
4474	1	a	"Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away ""i love it"" and i just did not. my husband looked and said it is just a ""blah"" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice, does not seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'("" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
4475	0	a	This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i did not try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
4476	0	a	I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass. had to send it back.
4477	1	a	This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!
4478	1	a	"I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned, the red is gorgeous! very saturated color, just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"", 135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length."
4479	1	a	Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.
4480	1	a	Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!
4481	1	a	"I love this denim jacket! it just a basic light denim jacket with a casual, pre-worn, soft feel. i like how it slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size, possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6,"" 125 lbs., and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model, i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!"
4482	1	a	I have a few pair of charlie and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on do not size up. definitely recommend these pants.
4483	1	a	This is a great casual skirt for summer, color pairs well with many tops.
4484	1	a	Exactly what i was looking for. cozy, not too warm, fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!
4485	1	a	This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.
4486	1	a	The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
4487	0	a	Ok, if i had a different body, this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband could not tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage), it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me, this is not the jumpsuit for you. this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters). for reference, i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th
4488	0	a	I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size
4489	1	a	I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.
4490	1	a	Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.
4491	1	a	I love the look and design of these pants. i'm 5'1, 110lbs and i ordered a 25p and still had to get them hemmed to even fit like pants. on the model, these look cropped but mine were even too long to be pants when i got them. i love the pant but if you are a petite, be ready to need alterations to the length!!
4492	1	a	This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i was not expecting. way better in person!
4493	0	a	I really liked the style of this top but it way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i ca not see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
4494	1	a	I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i
4495	1	a	I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.
4496	1	a	"I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short, i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1""). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately, they are all sold out of size 24 :("
4497	0	a	Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.
4498	1	a	This top is beautiful, however it runs beyond big!i ordered my usual size and i could have fit 2 of me in this top.i am reordering and going 2 sizes down!the tie back and embroidery is beautiful.
4499	1	a	I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i do not like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!
4500	1	a	Love this dress! it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it, like a young lady. it both classy and youthful! for reference, she 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.
4501	1	a	"I love that these are a nice thin stretchy material (not in a bad or cheap way) because they are perfect for the warm weather as well. i got the color grey in a size 29. i usually wear a 29 in stevie so they were tts. maybe a bit tight in the beginning but they do stretch a little with wear. i did try on the size 30 but they were a little big around the waist. for reference i am 5'6"", 145lbs, size 6/m. the fit of stevies are perfect and hugs in all the right places. i have wider calves and it"
4502	1	a	"This dress is really gorgeous, really fun and beautifully made. i'm typically an 8petite (140lbs, 5'4"", 34dd) so i got this in an 8 and it was huge on me. there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me. even if i sized down, it feels a little age inappropriate for me. i'm 21, and it felt very conservative and unflattering. i think this dress is excellent, just not for me."
4503	1	a	The details on this are beautiful. i love the gold thread and white beads. i thought the medium fit too large and got the small. it seems to fit really well. so you might want to size down one size. the only thing that seems a bit off it the length. it pretty long.
4504	1	a	I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these are not sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it definitely worth the buy!
4505	1	a	"Love this dress! i'm 5'7"", 135 lbs and typically wear either a small or x-small in maeve. since this one has lots of extra fabric, i ordered it in an xs and xxs. they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top, so i ended up keeping the xs. it great dress, lots of room and swings nicely."
4506	0	a	I really wanted to like this dress. the material, design, length and fit all over was perfect, except for the armholes- too big and the ruffles came right upto the nipple line. not comfortable with that. sadly, had to return.
4507	1	a	Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint.
4508	1	a	Love the draping on this top - covers the stomach area, and looks great on curvy girls.i am between sizes, and ended up purchasing the m. fits well. i chose the mauve, which is more of a light gray/purple.
4509	1	a	This is the second tulle skirt by bailey 44 that i have bought. the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent. i am normally a size 6 and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine. it is a pull-on skirt but the waistband does not have a lot of stretch to it.
4510	0	a	I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still did not fit, they run really small, i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
4511	0	a	This sweater is beautiful, especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves, just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater, so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection, or pushing the sleeves way up, which then results in
4512	1	a	"Soft, comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt. i'm 5'10"", 130...typically wear a 4. the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled. high hem hits me a few inches above the knee, low hem a few inches below."
4513	1	a	I purchased a petite size which fit great except for the slip. the slip is at least 2 inches shorter than dress. super comfy and flattering! perfect for fall with at pair of booties.
4514	1	a	"I love the flowy-beachy look of this jumpsuit, it is very comfortable, and super cute, my only ""gripe"" is that the hip part is pretty wide, hands in the pockets, you ca not tell, but if i were to get this, i would want a xxs. length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look. colors are very nice too, kind of ""70"", but i love it. i think i will get this if it goes to sale, even if it is a little big on me... i am 115 lbs, 30d chest and tried on xs."
4515	1	a	Great summer shirt. loose fitting, but especially wide. the button gather in back is a nice detail
4516	0	a	Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
4517	1	a	This skirt is so soft and warm! looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots. colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring!
4518	1	a	Very comfortable, feels like you're wearing pjs while being dressed up. fits true to size. very elegant dress, rich navy blue color. versatile, can wear with heels, boots, or flats.
4519	1	a	This shirt fits true to size. i love the cut of the shirt which adds some edge to a basic tee. i know i will wear this all the time throughout the fall and winter months. perfect to wear as is or layer with cardigans, jackets and scarves in cooler weather.
4520	1	a	I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress!it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i do not wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they do not fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it
4521	0	a	This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.this one is going back.
4522	1	a	This top is very airly and swingy. definitely need to wear skinny jeans to off set the volume on top. it is a pretty top and also unique so i kept it.
4523	0	a	Too big and it not secure enough to wear for swimming.
4524	1	a	Nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it the body i'm putting it on that less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just does not do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile.
4525	1	a	These pants are so flattering, comfortable, and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly.
4526	1	a	"I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately! i had to special order a petite size, but fits wonderfully. for me, ran a little large. i'm 5'2"" and 105 and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great!"
4527	1	a	Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!
4528	1	a	Girls, this dress is gorgeous. but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust. the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number. alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
4529	1	a	"Nothing ""skinny"" about these pants. they're very cute. great quality. but they run a good one size large. size down!"
4530	1	a	I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it would not be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i had not thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer
4531	1	a	I bought these yesterday and i love them! they are super comfortable, and are the perfect length and size. i'm 5'8 and 150. i tried on both the small and medium (small for kicks, but turns out they were a better fit!). the medium fit great too-albeit a little baggy on the thigh. these are now my go to pants for summer, and travel! i ca not wait to start wearing them!
4532	1	a	I was eyeing this dress for some time and was undecided about making the purchase. at a reduced price and 40%discount, i had to succumb! i was surprised by the fabric, a bit flimsy. however, the design makes up for the style. i'm anxious to wear at the first opportunity of spring/summer!!!
4533	1	a	I purchased in white. the material is a little thinner than i like, but the material is soft. runs tts over all. the arms are long-but i like this in a t-shirt. i will probably pick up another color in this shirt.
4534	1	a	I adore these pants! comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties. every time i wear them i am complimented on them!
4535	1	a	This dress fits really cute. i actually think it cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it great!
4536	1	a	"This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it perfect for hot days. i do not like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re"
4537	1	a	"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it the perfect between-season item.since i do not like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top would not work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy."
4538	0	a	This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back...
4539	0	a	I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy, poor quality for the price.
4540	1	a	I was a little skeptical to buy this dress at first because of the pattern. in all honestly, i am so happy that i did. it so unique and truly a one of a kind design. when tried on the dress is very slimming.
4541	1	a	These pants fit true to size. i have a small waist and curvy hips, and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie, these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg. the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall. the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points. i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea
4542	1	a	I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to
4543	1	a	Great peplum top, beautiful whine color. very thick material. i'm hourglass figure, 36d top so it was very flattering
4544	1	a	"This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon, so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..for reference, i am 5'5"", 125 lb., but have broad shoulders, making my usual best size a medium in most tops and"
4545	0	a	This shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent. this shirt runs ridiculously large. purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl. no impressed with the pattern in person. looks cheap. will be returning.
4546	1	a	I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.(and this brand has run small in the past)i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and widtheither way, this is a keeper!!it is adorable on, comfortable, my t-back bra works perfectly, very flattering, and way better than expectedthe shorts length is a little longer than pictured, but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an
4547	0	a	L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you do not spill out.
4548	1	a	"I am 5'3"" and 34c and bought the regular xs. it fits exactly as on the model. soft and light and comfortable, but very sheer. cami required (have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra). great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants. love!"
4549	1	a	Great turtleneck, very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.
4550	1	a	"Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season."
4551	1	a	This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.
4552	1	a	Another perfect maxi from retailer! the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my normal size in maxis (medium) and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight. i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i do not feel like i am showing too much cleavage. it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect.
4553	1	a	I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website do not do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.
4554	1	a	"Yes, it runs a little large - i usually get a s or m in tops, but for this i bought a s. i am 5'2"", 130 lbs, and i did not get the petite- i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture. i went into retailer looking for a dress, and walked out with this vest too - had to have. versatile, stylish, pockets, good quality!"
4555	1	a	True to size, nice unique shoulder/neckline fit and blousey/full on the bottom and arms which taper in. for me, i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition. though a vest or belt can also be used. sheer, you will need a cami. lovely flow and colors., the collar,pleats and neck tie add a romantic interest. just beautiful.
4556	1	a	The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult, but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.
4557	1	a	It is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.
4558	1	a	I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just did not work. i am busty, perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty, but the fit is selective, so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
4559	0	a	"I wanted to like this top, as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store, i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2"", 110 lbs), and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality, but unfortunately in this design, that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing."
4560	0	a	"I am 5'4"" 120lbs, got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy, great quality, unfortunate design. not worth the money."
4561	1	a	These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).
4562	1	a	I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just do not look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
4563	1	a	I ordered this dress in 0p since i am 5ft. it fits great its not too short just above the knee.
4564	1	a	This top is really cute - a light sweater with a feminine lace detail. i would recommend it if you're looking for a flowy, feminine top to wear before it gets really cold out. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because the material is a little prone to pulls and snags. i wore it once and got a pull from my cross body bag. thankfully, i was able to manipulate the threading and the pull is almost unnoticeable. but just know that it a pretty delicate sweater and you'll have to be careful
4565	1	a	I ca not wear this without getting dozens of compliments. plus, it comfortable! it very soft. it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots, with pants, or with skirts. i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. everyone wants to know where i got it! it very well made and the embroidery is well done. it does not look like it is going to come undone anytime soon.
4566	0	a	I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man
4567	1	a	I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.
4568	1	a	I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago. i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful! so is the design and construction. the fabric is very light and delicate. all the details on the dress are just top notch. the body of the dress is lined, but the sleeves are not - so there a slight see-through effect on the sleeves, showing the lovely and delicate knit. it fits like a dream, and i've
4569	1	a	"Loved everything about this sweater but the short length. did not notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length. it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or i'd be flashing my stomach all the time. worked a bit better with skirts, but still too cropped for my frame. wish it was 1-2"" longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite. really great color and design besides that. just make sure you are wanting the sh"
4570	1	a	Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size.thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.
4571	0	a	I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.
4572	1	a	The embroidery and side zip were well constructed. the fabric holds onto wrinkles and creases, so after a period of sitting, there are several creases pointing to one crotch area. this is not too noticeable, but definitely makes this a more informal garment.
4573	1	a	I got this in peach, and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee, over a dress, over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers, but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!
4574	1	a	"I did like this dress. it has a good simple shape, and is very comfortable. however, it plain, and for the price and it being dry clean only, i'll wait to see if it'll go on sale. it also worth noting that i'm 5'2"" and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite, but the regular size was a good length (right at the knees)."
4575	1	a	Versatile and flattering. i do not order many clothes online because i'm a tough fit and need to try on first, but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk. i love the high waisted, vintage style and the length is perfect. the bold color is fun. the little details are even better- navy blue piping, the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back. great skirt.
4576	0	a	First of all, this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said, it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size, and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy, durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c
4577	1	a	Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.
4578	0	a	The fit of the top is true to size, but i really do not like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also did not like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.
4579	1	a	This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore
4580	0	a	The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big. looks great on the model but awful on me.
4581	1	a	I love the feminine feel and look of this skirt. it is unique and matches many different shirts and looks great with a jacket. the only thing is it does run large. i ordered a 6 (my usual size) and it is very loose, not form fitting like the photo, but still cute and wearable. downsizing would've been better.
4582	1	a	The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,
4583	1	a	Love the luxury feel, so soft. perfect for day out. i'm 5'6 and the fit is just right. not too long or short. dalls right at the shoulders too.
4584	0	a	I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
4585	0	a	"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately, the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware."
4586	1	a	Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6, 125 pounds, and the size 2 fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size 2 petite. definitely worth the money.
4587	1	a	"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further, i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small, i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for"
4588	1	a	I did not have high hopes for these, because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color, i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies, but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom, so purchased the large, but sometimes i can wear medium, so this is great, being adjustable.
4589	1	a	....but not for me. i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in, but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs. right out of the bag, i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper. however, i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on. from the pictures, it looks like there is a small opening, but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back. this may not be the same for a taller person s
4590	1	a	I love this dress! perfect with high boots. and the quality of fabric looks and feels great. fits just like it shows in the picture.i am size 6 and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me. i like it a little looser for that boho look.
4591	0	a	Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
4592	0	a	Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
4593	1	a	"I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5"" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!"
4594	1	a	I did not look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top. it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors. but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.
4595	1	a	I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built
4596	1	a	I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and do not find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!
4597	1	a	"I am short (5'3'"") and have a short torso so the empire waist line was really flattering. i got the petite size small and it fell just above my knee. loose skirt portion led to an easy look to the dress. overall, super cute!"
4598	1	a	I love this top, the beading and detail is wonderful, i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person. but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short, definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model. i'm trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick!
4599	1	a	First off the prints are gorgeous - i ordered three. i wanted to love them but unfortunately i found them short and wide. so back they go..
4600	1	a	The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !
4601	0	a	I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short, even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!
4602	1	a	"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well."
4603	1	a	I just received this in the wine color and it gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i ca not wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.
4604	1	a	Fits nicely - i'm a standard size 4 most places. also perfect for those in-between occasions. can be dressed up or down and worn with flats or heels :)
4605	1	a	Super cute, a little buggier than expected but great for layering after the gym.
4606	1	a	I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.
4607	1	a	Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape, very flattering. however, the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...
4608	1	a	I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest would not stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i ca not stop thinking about it!!
4609	1	a	They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.
4610	1	a	I really wanted to like these. they're soft, long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(
4611	1	a	"Beautiful print and a flattering cut. however, the proportions are off. based on other reviews, i ordered a petite (i am 5'4"" and do not normally need a petite cut). i also ordered a size down. even the 0 petite requires that i wear 3-4 inch wedges and pin the top in the back to keep it in place. i am going to take it to a tailor to have the hem shortened and the top sleeves adjusted...then maybe the v neck wo not be almost to my belly button."
4612	0	a	Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just does not match up with the price point,
4613	0	a	This is a beautiful and warm sweater, well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing, especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.
4614	1	a	"As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the ""denim' one (multicolor). i did not end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i did not love is it looks wrinkled.i ordered the xxs and xsp - only tried on xxs as i did not think i would keep it anyway, but thinking of it, is should have still tried the xsp. arms were almost snug on me (i lift weight"
4615	1	a	I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple, but i do not own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down, which simply does not work for me, given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it not flattering. this top is flannel, no buttons, and off the shoulder, which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put
4616	1	a	I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.
4617	1	a	I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it would not really look right but omg, it 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.
4618	1	a	Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.
4619	0	a	I'm petite, but even if i were not, i think this runs very large, is not form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
4620	1	a	Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!
4621	1	a	Great fit and design but the wool is too itchy and rough. will need a layer underneath
4622	1	a	I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i did not have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.
4623	1	a	These shorts are really cute and are a flattering length. grey color has a silvery look to it. keepers.
4624	1	a	"Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans. bought these in a moment of ""treat yo' self"" mentality. absolutely do not regret it. at 5'7"", 27-28 waist, typically a 28 in denim - i got the 27s as i found that they not only fit in the waist, but were more slimming. black ""denim"" typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric - these have a great weight, perfect ratio of thickness:stretch, look incredibly sleek paired with anything. high rise keeps my belly in check, and a"
4625	1	a	"It actually is a pretty good t-shirt, but i wish that i had known that ""white"" actually means oatmeal with bits of grey and beige. i bought three and will now need to return them all. hopefully i can find it in other colors i like."
4626	1	a	This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it easy and comfortable to wear.
4627	1	a	I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,
4628	1	a	Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one. can be worn both on or off the shoulders. nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color. love the linen blend too. i'm a size 2 and i ordered the xs. flows away from body - -it a bit big but i like the style.
4629	1	a	Hands down, my new favorite top! love the look of this top! i would say this runs a little big. i definitely could have sized down. however, the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece.
4630	1	a	I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable, fits well (slightly large to size, but i prefer that), and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.
4631	1	a	This dress caught my eye because of the beautiful fabric, but i read the reviews online so i did not buy it. i just went to a store and could not help but try on the size small. i usually range from an xs to a s, and i would say that the size s fits great around my shoulders. it is true what the other shoppers say about this dress being like a tent. it is and i wo not lie about that. when i tried it on, i asked a sales person to bring me some belts to try on to create a waistline. once i put on a b
4632	1	a	I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i could not move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w
4633	0	a	They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
4634	1	a	I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!
4635	1	a	After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
4636	0	a	"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t"
4637	1	a	I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it was not going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.
4638	1	a	I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it subtle and i do not mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
4639	1	a	Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.
4640	1	a	This is a beautiful top. it unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.
4641	1	a	I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!
4642	1	a	Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans.
4643	1	a	"I love this skirt! it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt, that brought me to retailer in the first place. as the first reviewer said, this is a well-made striking skirt. it is tts (i usually wear a size 2 - and the size 2 fit perfectly; i am 36-17-36, and 122 lbs, 5'4"".) the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear."
4644	1	a	Very well made, wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
4645	1	a	This is a great top. soft and cozy fabric, nice and sturdy feeling. it heavier than i though it'd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring, and even a chilly summer night. i love that it long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings. the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug, however, i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt. the best part... it can be cleaned in the washer and drier! thrilled with this purchase!
4646	0	a	"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on, which is never a good reaction! even if i hemmed them, i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.better for"
4647	1	a	Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!
4648	1	a	I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful, bright colors; tried it on, and it was becoming, comfortable, and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago, have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.
4649	1	a	These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it is not as bright as shown in the pictures, but it a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this
4650	0	a	If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.
4651	0	a	This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt is not even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.
4652	1	a	I saw this online and thought the idea was super cute, but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical. but, when i went to the store to try it on, i saw it was anything but typical. the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft. i wanted the dress in the green, but they were already sold out in my size at the store, so i had to order it online. i cannot wait until it comes in! i will wear this often during the summer.
4653	1	a	"Really fun comfortable pants. i have not worn them yet as its hot here but i ca not wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days."
4654	1	a	Very cute everyday tee. usually run between an xs or small with retailer and was happy i chose the extra small. a great updated on a classic strip tee.
4655	1	a	It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.
4656	1	a	Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.
4657	1	a	"I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also did not appeal to me. i'll be returning them.the length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31"" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you're looking for loose fitting,"
4658	1	a	Completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy. looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work. i highly recommend this jacket!
4659	1	a	I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.
4660	1	a	This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.
4661	1	a	This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.
4662	1	a	I'm not much of a chino girl, but these fit like a favorite pair of jeans and with heels still look really polished. love them!
4663	1	a	I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry. thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar
4664	1	a	I purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left. but it fit like a large if not an xlarge! it a beautifully made sweater and really soft. i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there. it not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is, it not that flattering if it hanging on you. luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that it bette
4665	1	a	Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it not heavy, it weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it was not all stretched out. it got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
4666	1	a	This fabric feels a little bit like heaven. i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies. it adorable and the fabric is so soft. i think i'm in love. i'm 5'2 95 lbs. xxsmall was a perfect fit.
4667	1	a	Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!
4668	1	a	I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
4669	0	a	I love the fabric and design of these leggings, but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.
4670	1	a	"Was excited to find an retailer pkg awaiting in my mailbox. ripped open the package and immediately tried on the sweater. it did not disappoint. i bought turquoise in size medium. my regular retailer cardigan size. i am 5'3"" medium build and i find the regular size fits me true to size. it is not too long on me at all. i think the way the sweater drapes in a curve shape as it flows downs to the length of sweater makes it very accommodating for various heights, figures and is a flattering style for cu"
4671	1	a	"A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4"" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they do not stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they do not look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics"
4672	1	a	I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!
4673	1	a	"I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me, however, is totally wrong. for reference, i'm 32dd, 5'8"", 140 lbs, and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking, too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution."
4674	0	a	I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.
4675	1	a	"I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend ""cold shoulder"" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo"
4676	1	a	"For reference, i'm 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example, it linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area,"
4677	1	a	High quality, and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso.
4678	1	a	Ca not go wrong with these new charlie by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but does not seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you have not tried a pair of charlies you should. you
4679	0	a	I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model photos. the lace itself was pretty, intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just did not work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material, this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i
4680	1	a	This cardigan is very soft and feminine. it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere. i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room. if you do not mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater.
4681	1	a	Most comfortable and great looking! i got complements from everyone! literally!
4682	1	a	I got m in black with white. it ok. material is soft and nice. classy. plan to return it since color is not flattering, makes me look old.
4683	1	a	These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright, cheery, and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2, so i ordered the xs, and they are just right.
4684	1	a	I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.
4685	1	a	The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.
4686	1	a	I agree with the other reviewer, the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.
4687	1	a	"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it comfortable and well made. thicker material. seems to be holding up fine after one washing. looks great with skinny jeans. highly recommend!"
4688	1	a	Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.
4689	1	a	I happened upon this one in store in my xs size. online it would not catch my eye, but in person i love it. it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing, pleats, and length in the back. i could not pass this one up. i also agree with the other reviewers about colors:/
4690	1	a	"I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy. at 5'1"", they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length. i came to the website to get the petite length, hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length. these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy."
4691	1	a	Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i did not bother to order a size up because i was not sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color is not grey, like the picture. it a black and white checkered pattern. so, it does not look at all grey irl.i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea
4692	1	a	"I'm 5'4"" and weight 130 and i usually wear a small in dresses from retailer. although this fits everywhere, it a tad shorter than i expected based on the fact i figured the model was at least 5/7"" and this looks to be mid-thigh.. it mid-thigh on me so i'll be wearing tights and boots- ca not wear without tights...imho. otherwise, so comfortable and cute..."
4693	1	a	"I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs.i was a little worried the small might be too long &/or tentlike (i probably would have ordered a petite small had it been available), but it fits great!!!i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!"
4694	1	a	Great tunic top! is longer than i thought it would be so i probably could have sized down, definitely covered my butt! but overall a great print and cute top. loving it!
4695	1	a	This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.
4696	0	a	I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away, otherwise i wasted $100.
4697	1	a	I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!
4698	1	a	Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit did not quite work for me the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just did not look right altogether purchase the extra smalls in both and have since returned i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the storenice quality good colors
4699	1	a	This is a beautiful top! extremely classy. looks great with dressy trousers or jeans. drapes very nicely. the petite medium fits me perfectly (5'1 126 lb). love it! the embroidery ads so much. so pleased with this purchase!
4700	1	a	"This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes. i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it. it is unlike any fabric i've ever had: a soft two-ply, almost gauzy cotton. one cute detail is that the ""inside"" layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer. so cute! and so soft! one thickness above cheesecloth, i would say. and like cheesecloth, it has a natural ""give"" within the weave, but it is not stretchy. the shoulders"
4701	1	a	I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering. however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!
4702	1	a	I have not taken this off since i got it. and since then, i've ordered two more colors. it definitely sheer, but the blue is not see-through, though i expect the lighter colors are. it is a distressed look, but super-soft, comfy, and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans. really a nice summer top for hot days. i'm 5'4, 135 the and the xxs is perfect--drapey, but not baggy. very flattering straps too.
4703	1	a	I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim.
4704	1	a	It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.
4705	0	a	"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.5. the underarms bunched funny.6. the dress has h"
4706	1	a	Love this dress so much. it super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.
4707	0	a	When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.
4708	1	a	I got this in black with white dots. fits great, flattering and helps hide middle section.
4709	1	a	I first saw these in store, but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be!
4710	1	a	These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them.
4711	1	a	The style and fit are excellent, does not make you look frumpy or larger. just ca not get into the pattern combo--the white is too stark and i feel like it was slapped on my chest like a dickey. i have the paquerette and that a mixed bag of patterns that works really well. i'm not sure if i am keeping. i may have to bleed it out to soften the white. purchased size medium for my 36dd chest and wide rib cage.
4712	1	a	Love this dress. the fit is amazing. i wore it to church for my brother wedding and got so many compliments. it looks great in photos too!
4713	1	a	This is a very nice, flattering thing which can be worn as a dress or a shirt. therefore decided tiokeep it.
4714	1	a	Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy, but flattering.wearing it on my shoulders for work -
4715	1	a	Very well made dress but runs extremely small! definitely size up!
4716	1	a	I love this duster. it really different and interesting. i wear it with the dress in the picture but i have the green dress.
4717	1	a	This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.
4718	1	a	The photos do an amazing job of selling this coat. in person it is just a little bit less than what i was hoping for. the navy blue color is lovely and elegant and fits the sophisticated femininity of this style. black or khaki would be too boring.the fabric is soft and drapes and flows beautifully, but it is quite thin. if you hold the coat up to the light you can almost see through it! the thinness probably helps the flattering fit of the coat, but i do not know how effective that makes it at
4719	1	a	"I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding in june. i am 5'4"", 32d and 120lbs. i bought the size 2 and it fit like a glove, did not even have to wear a bra. the quality is beautiful. the fabric, stitching and detail are top notch and well worth the price. the way the seaming hits you on the hips and but is very flattering, especially for girls who may not be that curvy. it accentuates your curves for sure. it reminds me of an old hollywood, wiggle dress. with that being said the dress does h"
4720	1	a	"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering."
4721	1	a	"These chinos are very well made and has a really good fit. not too tight but a bit more relaxed so depending on the look you are going for, these are great! however, i ordered the bright aqua pair and received a pair that is really more teal. a bit disappointed but i'll live. i'm 5'4"" with a 30 inseam without shoes. these hit about half an inch below my ankle when not rolled up twice."
4722	1	a	Stumbled upon these in a size medium at the store and was initially very disappointed that they were too big. the sales associate found an x-small and suggested that i try them on. i was so pleased that they fit (but am definitely not an x-small at this point in my bottom ... i mean, life). wore these for a 4th of july party and felt elegant and comfortable all at once. they were just dressy enough with a white trapeze tank, long gold necklace, and gold sandals (i can only imagine them with
4723	1	a	"I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11"" so the shortness of the top is not a factor. the material drapes nicely and does not make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are"
4724	1	a	I bought the pink one. i like this salmon pink color! not too girly type of pink.the material is super soft and light. i have skinny torso, so it looks really nice on me not showing thin body...the only thing that disappointed me was it shrunk after the first wash... it shrunk one size! when i bought it (size s), it covered my flat hips, fits just like the picture, but now my hips are showing :(i recommend getting a size up if you are too lazy to wash cold & air dry.
4725	1	a	The material on this dress is gorgeous. so soft! the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots!
4726	0	a	Cute pattern, but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
4727	1	a	"I love the model pairing of this sweatshirt and was struck by it when i walked in the store! like the other reviewer said, you could dress up or down (despite the ""sweatshirt"" name) and i'm planning to wear it with the galleria corduroy skirt and gray booties. love the stitched pockets on the side! (but i'm unlikely to put anything there since it would probably fall out!)sizing: definitely boxy as the first reviewer said. i'm solidly a small in most tops, and this one i have a bit of spare"
4728	1	a	Very cute shirt, well made, nice detail, but a little long for my taste but i did keep it
4729	1	a	What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st
4730	1	a	I love the cut of this dress, and i'm rather short. i do not think you need to be tall. it a nice, light fabric that will work well for warm weather. it did wrinkle quite a bit during the day, but never looked messy. i certainly would not describe it as frumpy. it has a nice, loose, 1920s feel, and you can tighten the belt to make it more fitted through the waist. the belt is sewn on in the back, so you ca not take it off without quite a bit of tailoring. i had no trouble with the bust being too
4731	0	a	I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it is not really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one does not fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i do not know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j
4732	1	a	This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just do not think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it
4733	0	a	This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
4734	0	a	I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
4735	1	a	"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i did not notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top."
4736	1	a	I was looking for a classic, white t-shirt that was not too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it not too tight, but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d, size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!
4737	1	a	I love these shorts. i do not understand why they are not sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!
4738	0	a	I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
4739	1	a	This is way shinier in person than i expected, but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted, but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content, but that it.
4740	0	a	This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then did not look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
4741	1	a	Omg i love this sweater. it is minimalistic yet romantic. my mother in-law bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself. i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up. i will wear this for years. i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back. i've been wearing it with the ties in the front. what a bonus that there are 2 ways to wear this wonderful sweater. i will wear these 2 pieces for many, many years.
4742	1	a	The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels.
4743	1	a	"Lovely jeans, love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans, the relaxed ""boyfriend"" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute."
4744	1	a	I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!
4745	0	a	This is the first hd in paris top i have not loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put iton. too bad, but it went back
4746	1	a	I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it wool i did not notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent
4747	1	a	I just received this in the mail today, it is very cute however it will be going back, if you look at the picture of the back it look like there is only one opening however below the knot there is another opening,
4748	1	a	Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.
4749	1	a	"I loved this top, and i normally order petites when i'm able to, but this was not offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow, it is a petite! but its not, just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms, and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too, even on me (5'2"", about 118 lbs"
4750	0	a	I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
4751	1	a	"I love this skirt. unfortunately, no petite sizing was available when it was affordable (on sale). i purchased the 6 regular (based on ""small waist"" reviews) thinking i'll just have it shortened. did not realize there are 4 layers and tailoring would have cost $60+. was considering anyway, but when pinned up, the skirt lost its fullness and i did not care for that look. if anyone has a 6 petite they want to off-load or exchange with me for a 6 regular, am very happy to do so. this is one skirt i"
4752	0	a	This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i have not figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.
4753	1	a	These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!
4754	1	a	Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.
4755	1	a	"I love wearing this sweater, it is unbelievably soft and cozy. usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me, so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame. i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and it was long, but not at all overwhelming. it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day. i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels. would look great with leggings and bo"
4756	1	a	This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale, and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!
4757	1	a	I bought this in the sable green. you can wear this blouse tucked in, or out if you're wearing something lie leggings. it is comfortable and the color is very flattering.
4758	1	a	I love everything about this top! the fabric, the color, the fit! great top for spring and summer!
4759	1	a	Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!
4760	1	a	"I tend to go back and forth between small and xs and i""m glad i got the xs... its great and still flow and not huge. to wear alone you need a strapless but i am happy it has adjustable straps. the lace on the back is fabulous snd the colors in this are so lovely! it has olive green and deep orange, two of my fall favs! i wore with my level 99 deep orange linen pants and an olive green little jacket over it. would also be lovely with jeans and booties... a creamy cardigan or a little blazer. i th"
4761	1	a	This top is great! it looks much better in person. it still kind of a faded look but it not as light as shown here. also, the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice, loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.
4762	1	a	I probably would not have even tried this on in the store, but i took a chance when it was on sale. i put it on and it was immediate love. the fit is perfect. i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large. it is not boxy, but not too tight either. it feels well made.
4763	1	a	I bought these in the store today. they're a great jean. none of the pairs i saw had as much distressing as the picture. there were no holes, which i'm actually grateful for, i do not like holes in jeans. anyway these had a great fit for me. they fit more like a slim straight jean on my curvier figure and really flatter my backside- they are not baggy, as pictured on the model. they're a great casual jean which i know will be my new staple! (even better- my husband gave them a big thumbs up!)
4764	0	a	I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly, it is already pilling and does not seem to be holding up very well (photo giv
4765	1	a	Love the fit and color of this top. i love that it is somewhat fitted around the arm holes which does not allow for extra skin to show. it drapes nicely over my hips and tummy. got rave reviews from my husband!!
4766	1	a	Very comfortable and cute. i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store, i was disappointed. however, after trying it on, i had to have it. very flattering and comfortable.
4767	1	a	Great fit, can be dressy or casual, goes with everything, i adore tis jacket!
4768	0	a	This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant, but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.
4769	1	a	"A flattering soft basic! i'm 5'2"" 120 lbs and purchased the small on sale."
4770	1	a	"I'm obsessed with the perfect"" leather look "" coated jeans.. i have another high end denim brand in black.. i may like these better.. they fit perfect maybe a tad big?high enough so potential bottoms shows when bending .. perfect stretch ..not to leathery looking just enough. the ties at ankle are different ...i would love these in black! but this color is awesome, and this cut very flattering . for reference i'm a 16 bottom, smaller waste bigger booty .. size 33 fit perfect .."
4771	1	a	I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that why i do not need a cami underneath.
4772	1	a	I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!true to size and nice length.the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.very nice!
4773	1	a	This top is super cute, nice and light for the hot weather, with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra, so it shows through. but, with a black bra, there is no problem.
4774	1	a	I have several tiny tunics in m. i received this one today and it is very cute but too tight in the chest. i'm returning it for a large.
4775	1	a	The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.
4776	1	a	More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.
4777	1	a	I ordered these in eptites, tey were a ltitle long still. also a tiny bit on the loose side. i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost, so wil lwait for hte sale. color combination was nice though,a dn the cut relatively flattering, i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price. nice business/casual pant.
4778	0	a	I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i could not try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i do not think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
4779	1	a	I really did not expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we
4780	1	a	I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i did not like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i could not wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning.
4781	1	a	"This skirt did not fit me right--i'm 5'6"" and the hem hit too low, making for a frumpy rather than classic look. the fabric and color are lovely, however, and on a taller person this could be beautiful. the draping is beautiful and slimming."
4782	1	a	Love this dress! it so soft & not to short like some retailer dresses. great transition piece! i'm a fan of bell sleeves & ca not wait to wear this with boots& tights this fall.
4783	1	a	I love the versatility of this top. i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down.
4784	1	a	I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.
4785	1	a	I saw this top online, but i did not fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'
4786	0	a	They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
4787	1	a	"This sweater is super cute with the mock neck. i love all 3 colors. i typically wear either an xs or s in retailer sweaters, and purchased a s in this one. now that i've put it on again at home, i'm wondering if i should have sized up to a m mainly due to the sleeves and hem of the sweater being short. i'm 5'6"" (and 126 lbs), so not overly tall and do not typically have this issue. i feel like the model (who is likely taller than me) has to have on at least a size l and have the sweater pinned back"
4788	1	a	I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric, which is soft, lightweight, and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun, and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width, for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes, but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough, and the shirt hits me just at the hip, not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a
4789	1	a	I thought this was a pretty and unique top. the material looks and feels like a basic t-shirt made into a striking fitted top. this is not apparent in the online pictures: the side seams are slitted open nearly up to the waist, so it is a bit revealing. my only problem with this shirt was that the bottom part flared out too much away from my body, and there is a lot of material there, so i was not sure if i could get it tailored to look good on me.
4790	1	a	I found this top to run very large. i wear a medium in most retailer tops but often a large in other brands, i had to return this for a small. it was worth the effort however, extremely cute top that i can see wearing on its own or under a blazer for a night out.
4791	1	a	"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus"
4792	1	a	Overall: a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere. short, petite ladies beware though; the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the model photos. in order for me to have it sit at my waist, the dress was folded over and did not flatter.
4793	1	a	Love the warm color and soft fabric - paired with chic tights and ankle boots and it fits right into a more casual workplace.
4794	0	a	I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large. i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top. i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem. below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
4795	1	a	This is a beautiful coat and the fit and weight are perfect. my only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that the lapel do not lay perfectly flat. i read some complaints about the placement of the button but it does not bother me. otherwise it a gem and i'm going to keep it.
4796	0	a	Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i ca not wear them anymore..so disappointed!
4797	0	a	I love the feel and quality of these pants, however, they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist, unfortunately.
4798	1	a	Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w
4799	1	a	I got them in green and the color is very nice.the waist is a little higher than the ag cords, but that only makes them comfortable and holds the tummy in a littlegood length and the pant holds up nice thru out the day, no sagging yet in the knee and behind area
4800	1	a	Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends, vacations, and just to be adorable in!
4801	1	a	I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit was not too boxy on me, but i'm between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i did not have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!
4802	1	a	Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse, i purchased this blouse. it true to size, size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich, a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it, and of course, the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect, feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly
4803	0	a	Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. does not itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
4804	1	a	Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!
4805	1	a	This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear
4806	1	a	Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.i do wish they came in more colors.
4807	1	a	I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard, and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit, the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose, and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it act
4808	0	a	I ordered this and there is just so much fabric! in the pictures i think it is pinned in the back, in the main photo, to make it look more streamlined. definitely a miss!
4809	1	a	This is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!
4810	0	a	I wanted to love this dress, but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue, but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling, but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust, and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my
4811	1	a	Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!
4812	1	a	"Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2"", 115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose. this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now. i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it! nice comfortable material which is not hot for summer. got the regular si"
4813	1	a	"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it simple and sexy, easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect, i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i do not typically wear red so that was not an option for me, i do wish it came in more colors!"
4814	1	a	I am very happy with the top.well made and beautiful color.
4815	0	a	This dress is not as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are, it does not look great on me. for reference, i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason, the high neckline is not flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.
4816	0	a	Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
4817	1	a	Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?
4818	1	a	This dress is easy to dress up or down, and is very comfortable.
4819	1	a	"This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges. .i got the size ' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2"" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d, 32c, even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back, but i"
4820	1	a	"I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i do not like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!"
4821	0	a	Generally, i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent, so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it till way too small! in addition, the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this, and the right strap was defective! it so irritating that i have to return this again!
4822	1	a	I love this dress! very comfortable fit, and lots of compliments for the color (moss). took me from the classroom to a cocktail party. one of my best retailer purchases.
4823	0	a	Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
4824	1	a	I have this shirt in more than one color! i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique! i personally feel the material is not scratchy at all! also, i love this designer they are one of my new favorites!
4825	1	a	These pants are so great. very comfortable, true to size, and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, and my usual 26 petite fit great. these would also make excellent travel pants. i purchased the green color, and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review.
4826	1	a	Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.
4827	1	a	Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!
4828	1	a	The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it does not show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin
4829	1	a	This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.
4830	1	a	This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.
4831	1	a	Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually is not and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!
4832	1	a	I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p
4833	1	a	I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.
4834	1	a	Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.
4835	1	a	So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that, no difference. in fact, it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously, if you do not dry clean this, you are going against manufacturer recommendations, but i
4836	1	a	Perfect slimming fit. wore it to work and then on to a holiday party. received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening!
4837	1	a	This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small), though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall, it is really very flowing and lovely on, with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.
4838	1	a	"This top is just darling! the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that dyed to appear well used. the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured. great to wear with leggings! the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered. extremely comfortable, machine washable. an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment. i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl."
4839	1	a	If you have not yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon, now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy, elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful, put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size, i am a 4 and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5'10. form fitting but still a bit f
4840	1	a	I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while. i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years. in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality. but not this little pilcro jacket. great quality, perfectly proportioned, great understated details. many thanks retailer for restoring my faith.
4841	1	a	This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail. sure to sell out.
4842	1	a	This top is beautiful in person, love the buttons in the back, fits a little boxy but i like that style
4843	1	a	This top has a flattering shape. the neckline is low, but not too low for work, and it flares a bit at the bottom. my only complaint is that it is short. i have a longish torso and this shirt hits right at the top of my pant waistline. i just prefer tops to be a bit longer, but it still a cute top.
4844	0	a	I love the colors in this top, but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare, and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed, and sadly will be returning this. for reference, i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops, but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
4845	1	a	Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes
4846	1	a	First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.
4847	0	a	This fit well, but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and did not order it online. with different fabric, it would have been great.
4848	1	a	This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost did not send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.
4849	1	a	Beautiful skirt, love the colors. so glad i bought this. runs a little big
4850	1	a	Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i do not roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.
4851	1	a	I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops
4852	0	a	This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric, especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however, the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition, the bow seemed to be too t
4853	0	a	This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i could not wear it :(
4854	1	a	This skirt is gorgeous- the picture does not do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it, the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
4855	0	a	"I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9"", 140lbs, and 34d)."
4856	0	a	I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it meant to be a relaxed fit, but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me, so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size, but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
4857	0	a	I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric, lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller, but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom, unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs, it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.
4858	1	a	Love this shirt! so comfortable and the style is really flattering.
4859	1	a	I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit! i am post-baby (six weeks) and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size. and it will only get better! the quality and color are great!
4860	1	a	The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.
4861	1	a	Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.
4862	1	a	I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i have not tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.
4863	1	a	This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.
4864	1	a	These days i am more like a 6 after gaining some weight. when i was in my local retailer the other day i happened upon this dress only in a small/petite. i tried it on and it actually fit me very well. i am 5 foot 6 so i thought the petite might be too short or would not work, but surprisingly it fit my body type. i think i'll like wearing it best with a pair of wedges or heels. like most other reviews i'm inclined to agree that the regular size has too much fabric going on and probably is s
4865	1	a	Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
4866	1	a	I love this sweater and do not think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and could not be happier. it great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i would not have hesitated to pay full price!
4867	1	a	This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available.
4868	1	a	I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!
4869	1	a	This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric is not as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.
4870	1	a	This dress is comfortable, hugs and skims at all the right places, and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns were not sold out.
4871	0	a	These ran true to size, but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs, but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist, but the legs just did not work for me. sadly returning these.
4872	0	a	I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest, but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape, it'd be worth it, but it going back.
4873	1	a	"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, does not ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m"
4874	1	a	"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality, though, as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition, as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still, a versatile dress, for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper."
4875	1	a	Saw this tee on line and thought i'd give it a shot - the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly! i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too. great shirt!
4876	0	a	This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
4877	1	a	"I am very particular about jeans. it not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend."
4878	1	a	"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large, and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy,"" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous, but a thin camisol"
4879	1	a	This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok, will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.
4880	0	a	I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i could not get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
4881	0	a	This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater heds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.
4882	0	a	The colors of this top are perfect for spring, i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i did not like and primary reason i may be returning, is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this, as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
4883	0	a	Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons: it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock,under my arm, which could be seen, i guess, if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos! next, who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea? if i had gotten a nice patterned top, i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
4884	1	a	This is an interesting skirt. the fabric is comfortable, breathable and flowy. it is eye-catching. but the pattern is not one i would say i love, although i do like it. the lighter color in the pattern is more pink than off-white, which is fine, but that did surprise me a little. overall, i kept it for comfort and because i liked it enough for the sale price i paid for it.
4885	1	a	"Beautiful detail in the bodice... but i'm either too short or it a bit too long for me. ;) have not yet decided if i ""can"" keep it. material is elegant, details are beautiful."
4886	1	a	"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model, or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit, perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater."
4887	1	a	I bought this dress for my sister bridal shower, and it was a hit! i was a little bit surprised when it arrived because i did think it was going to be actual tweed - it is not. it is simply a tweed pattern! i think it makes a little bit more casual, but it was a fun dress for an afternoon bridal brunch! one thing i wish it had - pockets!!
4888	1	a	"I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually ""just a raincoat"". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i would not go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute"
4889	0	a	I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.
4890	0	a	This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
4891	1	a	Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.
4892	1	a	I love this top! i'm 5'7'', 135 lb and the small fits well (probably could have fit in the xs). it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom. i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe. highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average t-shirt.
4893	1	a	Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part is not under my boobs. kinda have
4894	1	a	I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that a plus.
4895	1	a	This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down
4896	1	a	I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i could not resist this blouse. it so beautiful and fun! i ca not wait to wear it!
4897	1	a	I usually wear a small or medium depending on the cut, but this one only worked in a large. with or without a bra, it was not too low and covers all the middle area flaws beautifully. bust size average and i have muscular (not sticks) arms and a fairly wide back. nice and drapey, pretty green color. great sale price.
4898	1	a	This dress is stunning- vibrant colors and flirty feel to it. i got the small and i am a 34b/27 pants, 132 lbs- great fit. i only question two things- am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra? those two considerations are why i did not give it 5 stars.
4899	1	a	I love these pants. they are very flattering and comfy, and look like real leather. they are also machine washable which is great. i've worn mine 5 times already.
4900	1	a	I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. ca not wait to wear.
4901	1	a	Love this top, looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short, so for me the high waist pants were a must, but if you do not mind showing your belly, then it would be cute with anything, the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.
4902	1	a	So this skirt is everything. the only downside is that it not in a petite sizing so i'm going to have to get this altered (i'm 5'3). the sizing is appropriate (usually wear an 8 or 10 in pants and got a size medium for the skirt), the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather, the color is just right (not too light), the pockets are adorable and i feel like i'm channeling some 70 realness, sits higher on your waist, and is super comfortable. i know i'm going to get a lot of use o
4903	1	a	I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.
4904	1	a	I like the color of this dress, but its a little thin for fall. on me, the neckline is more round and the sleeves a little cappier. i have dresses in this brand in both a size small and medium. i went with a small in this dress. returning it for a medium.
4905	1	a	Very much liked this shirt for super casual days. its got a very flowy and boxy fit to it with side slits. it runs a bit big compared to what it looks like on the model.
4906	1	a	Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.
4907	1	a	This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top, but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill.
4908	0	a	I ordered this in black and red. i had high hopes based on the reviews this received, but it just ok. i will be returning.
4909	1	a	I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i ca not wait to unveil this new piece at work.
4910	1	a	"This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. i'm 5""7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s."
4911	1	a	After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,
4912	0	a	This top is really cute and i love the design. however, the first time i wore it, the waste band started unraveling.
4913	1	a	I ca not wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!
4914	0	a	I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it did not met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt, it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
4915	1	a	Love the color, weight and styling on this sweater. it is soft and comfortable and i will wear it a lot. the only downfall is that it sheds, so it can not be worn with leggings or you will end up with fuzz everywhere.
4916	0	a	This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i was not the only customer with this issue.
4917	1	a	Probably one of my favorite turtle neck sweaters! it looks so chic and cute on!!
4918	1	a	Dig this top but a little different from what i was expecting. the outside is indeed a bit stiff and scratchy but it is lined ... but definitely would've appreciated a softer fabric. however, the cut is cute and flattering and the pattern is adorable so it staying in my closet. perhaps not the thing to wear to snuggle up with someone though!
4919	1	a	I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.
4920	0	a	Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
4921	1	a	"I ordered this online in red. i would definitely say this color is more of an orange-red. i like the weight and the cut. i keep wishing the material was a soft modal vs what it is. the ribbing up top does not bother me but it definitely does make it a casual dress. (which is what i wanted so i'm happy with it) it fits me nicely, the straps (for me) could be a hare shorter to fit perfectly. that being said, i'm 5'5"" and have a thin build. small bust. i would say there is a some leeway for 1 s"
4922	1	a	Easy to wear, but still has a lot of style. i see this becoming a new basic.
4923	1	a	I hoped to love this based on the prior review, but i did not. it a beautifully crafted top but the print did not look good on me. and although i grabbed during the sale it too expensive to keep when it not perfect.
4924	1	a	Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.
4925	1	a	I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you do not mind those things, then you might like it. it definitely worth the try.
4926	1	a	"These are great pants. i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad. i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants. i wear these to work and they are very comfortable. kind of stretchy, but very flattering. the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for work-allows them to look less ""jean"" like. i highly recommend these-ca not believe they aren'"
4927	1	a	This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.
4928	0	a	I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews, but as you can see, the dress did not live up to them. i ordered a size 8, and maybe a 6 would've fit better, but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout, and there really should not be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding, but as a member of the wedding party, i do not think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it headed
4929	0	a	I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape did not help. the top fit well, in my usual 4 petite, i think it would look nice on some people, as it something different but i am not one of those it worked on.
4930	1	a	Let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans, the script, and hyphen to name a few, absolutely love them, they fit tts, super soft with just the right amount of stretch. the em jean have the perfect retro look, super soft, with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish. unfortunately, i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer, andddddd, they are no longer made in the usa, but in china....so you may need to try on
4931	1	a	The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom, like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. does not seem to be easy to snag.
4932	1	a	I purchased this dress off the reviews.unfortunately i have to return it. i expected it to fit as they said. i am 5'1'- 120 lbs. 35/b-c. i got the s petite. i could not even get this dress on over my chest. the waist was on top of my chest. i really was disappointed . the material is so soft, i would have had to purchase a m in a regular to fit me. and it would have looked terrible on me. so, i would say, for a tall thin girl , yes , a short girl a no. and i am very petite.
4933	0	a	"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it."
4934	1	a	This sweater is the best sweater to throw on over a buttoned blouse, t-shirts, long sleeves, tanks. i always get comments on how comfortable and adorable this sweater is. a worthwhile buy.
4935	1	a	"Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3"" high heels. i am5 '3"", and probably would have beenbetter with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however, busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt, w"
4936	1	a	Runs shorter than i expected. i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size.
4937	1	a	It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!
4938	1	a	"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter."
4939	0	a	Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on, the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.
4940	0	a	"I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it loose and flows but does not look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once."
4941	1	a	Maybe i should not have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i would not recommend it.
4942	1	a	Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
4943	1	a	Super soft and the trimming on the neckline and sides adds character to the shirt. runs a bit shorter than i expected.
4944	1	a	"I am 5'6"", 130lbs, size 27, short-legged, and these jeans fit perfectly. i've learned that pilcro serif fit is my go to, and these did not disappoint. not only are they a flattering fit, they are the ideal medium blue denim, and they are not covered in excessive whiskering, which seems to plague most jeans."
4945	0	a	I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really do not think it worth the price and it not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
4946	1	a	These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.
4947	1	a	It is a little roomy so if you're between sizes go with the smaller. i think it flattering even if you have a larger chest. love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality!
4948	1	a	The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!
4949	1	a	I saw this in store, but they did not have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.
4950	1	a	Absolutely gorgeous shirt. the quality is outstanding! only problem is that it is too small. i am usually a perfect size 6 and this will not zip. returning for a size 8. you wo not regret buying it!
4951	1	a	"I'm trying to buy more basic, versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm, 5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price."
4952	1	a	Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate, but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.
4953	1	a	I bought this dress for work and receive tons of compliments when i wear it! the material is soft and breathable, which makes it comfortable to wear all day at work with a light jacket. i do agree with the other reviewer though, it does show every bump, especially in the tummy. i also noticed that some of the fabric flaps will flip up when i sit down, but i am going to sew the flap down so it stops doing that.
4954	1	a	This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it even cuter online. the material is great and you ca not go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!
4955	1	a	Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short.,
4956	1	a	This is a terrific top! the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black. i love that antho is listening, and that it made in the usa! the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering. i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f. the sleeves are nice and long. do not miss out on this classic tee, friends!
4957	1	a	Fits great and super flattering
4958	1	a	"Do not wait. get this dress now before it disappears. it is gorgeous, it is well made. it is like butter. the fit is perfect and the workmanship is stunning. everything about this screams, ""lets go party!."" oh yeah... and the skirt part kind of swishes around as you dance. you cannot get more charming than this."
4959	1	a	This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
4960	1	a	The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter, but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd), however, i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also, the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
4961	0	a	Do not buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it more like a medium or large.
4962	1	a	I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly
4963	1	a	I first saw this shirt on one of the workers at the retailer stores and it looked beautiful. i loved it so much i had to order it when it came on sale. the fit is a little too short for my liking, but i think i can make it work. also, it does fit a little snug around the arms but it at least it does not show your undergarments. overall, i think it is absolutely beautiful. the fabric has a beautiful shimmer to it and it looks easy to dress up for a day at the office or a night on the town, or paired
4964	1	a	This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
4965	0	a	The shirt design is very nice, but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.
4966	1	a	"These are cute...nice overall fit (tts) and length was like model on my 5'7"" frame...quality and comfort were also nice. for me the issue was color...when they came in at first i did a double-take wondering what i had ordered and if it was the right item. the colors are very bright, most notably an almost neon orange. the colors plus the diagonal lines/blue hem combo felt a little clown-like to me. i try to pick versatile items that i can wear multiple ways, and i just could not imagine many ways"
4967	1	a	I am on the fence on this one........it quite beautiful as color goes, the pic online seems rather faded. i just felt it was a bit wider on the bottom than might be flattering otherwise. beautifully made and the fabric is of great quality. i just i wish some of these tops were in better proportion from top to bottom, and less bulky.other than that i still may purchase as the print is beautiful..........
4968	1	a	I ordered the peach version in size xl. it fit true to size--matched the photos online. i hand washed it and it did shrink a bit. the fabric & knit used are so soft. the color is so pretty too.
4969	0	a	I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n
4970	1	a	These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.
4971	1	a	I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar, but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome, the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c, broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting, it would be a perfect top! soft, cool fabric, great for summer.
4972	1	a	I normally wear a size 12 because of my shoulders and back. after reading reviews after purchasing dress online, i was expecting it to be too small. it is, in fact, somewhat large. i love the way i feel in it. i am 5'8 and the length is perfect. i cannot wait to wear it. the black is so soft. love the boho feel, yet classic and feminine..
4973	0	a	Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt wo not work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.
4974	1	a	The material is soft and the length is great. you can wear it with short or skinny jeans. the only drawback is the color because it is so light. it is pastel so if you like pastels it will be great for you.
4975	1	a	These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these wo not keep you warm in the winter.
4976	1	a	This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!
4977	1	a	These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.
4978	1	a	This dress is not only beautiful, it so comfortable to wear. it also very flattering. i love that i can wear the dress with sandals or boots. great buy!
4979	1	a	"I like the way this vest looks: it flattering and the color is nice, just like in the pictures (i got the orange one). i am 5'7"", 125 lb, got size s, and i am very happy about the fit.just keep in mind that the material is very soft and thin. it is good for summer, but i expected the material to be more... firm... something to be worn on cooler windier days. also, the vest does not close - i would prefer the vest to have a zipper or buttons.but if you need a fun and cute summer accesso"
4980	1	a	"This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also ""firm"" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please."
4981	1	a	So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it does not seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.
4982	1	a	Heavy in weight but not uncomfortable to wear because it fully lined and has an easy fit that skims without looking like a potato sack! fits a little large but mainly tts. if you're between sizes, then i would size down, unless you're very blessed from the waist down. i am a m/l on top and s/m on bottom and bought the medium. it a relaxed dress (like a shift suppose to be) that i can wear a turtleneck under without feeling stuffed.
4983	1	a	I've never bought a tee at full price, in so many colors. i love this tee.it quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'2 -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple, navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio
4984	1	a	Love this, but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic, the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it
4985	0	a	I ordered two of these, the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference, i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me, the style was just off. i had to return both.
4986	1	a	Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i could not decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i do not think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.
4987	0	a	This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
4988	1	a	Cute dress. can be worn with boots, flats, or heels. i am 5'1, 112 lbs, 34 b chest and i got this dress in size petite small. i am pear shape, with a bigger bottom, and love how dress enhances my shape! my style is more classic, but i really like this dress.
4989	1	a	They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.
4990	1	a	I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.
4991	1	a	This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.
4992	1	a	"What a perfect dress! it was perfect for a black tie optional wedding. i did not want another ""black dress"" but when i saw this i knew it was something special! i am 5'5 130lbs and 34dd- the size 8 fit my top better but the size 6 length was better but i decided to stay with the size 8"
4993	1	a	I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.
4994	1	a	I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it just so cute, flattering, so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it always the good stuff that ca not be replaced
4995	1	a	Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it, you will have it forever!
4996	1	a	I was so excited for this to come in the mail, once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive, it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe
4997	1	a	Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.
4998	1	a	"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but does not squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an"
4999	1	a	These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.
5000	0	a	I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large, or something? ! i ordered an xs, my usual size, xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose, the upper arms are a bit snug, and i do not have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place, but when you look at the model, it does not look so bad. with the shirt i received, and another reviewer, the seam was puffy, making for a strange look. in theory, the shirt should have worked, but did not. i loved the pattern, not the fit.
5001	1	a	Surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable. have had many compliments on this. super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top. and a plus--no signs of pilling yet.
5002	1	a	Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it does not matter that it high waisted but i do not have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.
5003	0	a	This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of, it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
5004	1	a	I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but do not care for the way they sit on the hips.
5005	1	a	I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i do not think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.
5006	1	a	This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it were not sold out in my size. love it!
5007	1	a	/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.
5008	0	a	While there is nothing wrong with this top, it did not really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store, maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just do not like it that much, especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.
5009	1	a	This dress is well made, great fit, perfect a-line. the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture, but it fits well even with a large chest. completely flattering and i would highly recommend!
5010	1	a	I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me, however
5011	1	a	"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?"
5012	1	a	"I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m"
5013	1	a	Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands, dropping off kids.
5014	1	a	This sweater is substantial, well-made, fabric is thick and comfortable. the length is on the shorter side, not cropped but shorter, perhaps if they had petite, ti would be cropped. the sleeves are perfect length too on me, it looks shorter on the model, they hit at mys wrists (i do usually need petite length). it seems a simple top, but it is quite beautiful in person. i strongly recommend it, even for the price...xs and i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist
5015	0	a	I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
5016	0	a	This romper fit like a dream! it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on! there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody got time for that!!!! i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you! i considered buying the romp
5017	1	a	These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band did not cut in my sides.
5018	0	a	Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment, both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it stiff and scratchy, the style is very boxy, and as another reviewer said, just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
5019	0	a	This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.
5020	1	a	I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.
5021	0	a	"When i ordered this dress, i thought to myself ""hmm, it seems a little close to showing some side boob, but maybe that just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep, that some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim, this might be a good look, but on a curvy gal with some boobs, it was obscene. also, i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands, so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl would not even zip up. returning."
5022	1	a	"Love this dress! it a little roomy on me & i maybe should have gone with the medium. i'm 5'11"" and about 165 so usually wear a large. my problem is with the length. i knew it was a gamble, but the other color images on the 5'10"" model gave me the hope that the dress would come close to being near my knees ... nope. it a good 6"" above them, and i could not wear this to work. so being the crafty sort, i'm pondering adding a few more lace layers to the hem."
5023	1	a	I somehow overlooked this online and saw it in the store. i am a 10/12 or m/l. i tried on the medium and it was tight in the bust but fit great in the waist. i ended up ordering the large online. the large felt good but a tad big in the waist. it hit my true waist though and looked good. i then noticed the straps were agustable. i wonder if i tried the medium and loosened the straps if it would have worked. either way i love the dress, so pretty and flowy. i was not bothered by the fabric and did
5024	1	a	Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.
5025	1	a	I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected, which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however, i did keep it because
5026	1	a	This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on.
5027	1	a	"This shirt is amazing! it an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors."
5028	0	a	This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website), but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand), and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase, absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.
5029	0	a	Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it by maeve (go figure).this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.
5030	1	a	I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it very spring and light weight! love it very much!
5031	1	a	I am a curvy woman and leggings are new to my world. i am sorry that i did not discover these leggings sooner because they are lovely. they are comfortable and cozy with a great fit. i am 150 lbs and 5'7 and the m/l fit perfectly. i have the black and plum colors. great purchase!
5032	1	a	I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top, or down with a slouchy sweater and boots, or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise, as i am short waisted, and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering, and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no
5033	1	a	Great purchase! i bought the coat to wear to work.
5034	1	a	I really love this top. they show it as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.
5035	0	a	"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader skirt) and the neckline was way"
5036	1	a	Love the subtle print - makes these good for work and for play. will wear with wedge booties, flowing top and jacket. perfect outfit.
5037	1	a	This dress runs very large. i am usually wear an xs but i had to get xxsp-runs large through the mid section and arm holes. very comfortable and super cute on.
5038	1	a	"Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you."
5039	1	a	I'm consistently a 0p in this brand, but i ordered a regular zero, and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it a bit boxy, and the material is thicker than i thought, but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!
5040	1	a	This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.
5041	1	a	I adore this dress. it has a fairly thick material, which helps the skirt stay full and is very flattering if, like me, your thighs or tummy can be a problem area in dresses! the only downside for me is the fact that i have fairly narrow shoulders, so the seam for the sleeves tends to stick out a bit! i get lots of compliments on this one!
5042	1	a	Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up, they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.
5043	1	a	"Nice weight and loved the design, but the inside was what i loved the most. it does not show in the photos, but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided, so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there was not enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold"
5044	1	a	"This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i do not like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it hand washable. i have not worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace."
5045	1	a	I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!
5046	1	a	I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here, but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.
5047	1	a	Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.
5048	1	a	You ca not go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so do not agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.
5049	0	a	With all of the glowing reviews of this dress, i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely, the quality was great, but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time, kept glancing down to make sure i had not come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut, but decided to take it back. i did not see tha
5050	1	a	"My new favorite. i purchased the ivory in a medium, and the lilac in a large when it went on sale (medium was already sold out). i'm 5'7"" and about 125 pounds, 34c give or take. the medium fits great, and i found the large only slightly bigger, but it does not look too big. i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweaters.as was previously noted, the back is cut higher than pictured. i actually like this, as it gives the sweater a unique look. i tend to layer with a button down for the"
5051	1	a	This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick, it is soft, and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my
5052	1	a	"Love the tunic. rich color. longer than i thought. i am 5'9"", 140 and it almost comes to mid thigh. also ordered medium - it is roomier than anticipated. but looks good loose and flowing.overall love the tunic, the shape, style and will have big fun wearing it."
5053	1	a	Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!
5054	1	a	I ordered this in size xl. it fits true to size. it does have a boat neckline which runs a little tight on me. but, everything else feels comfortable. i know this is not a flattering style. horizontal stripes on my plus-sized, pear-shape is not my favorite. but, i love the back. the knot is not very comfortable to lean against. i just love the lace in the back that i wear it when running short errands where i do not have to lean back a lot. it does need a tank underneath or it see-through in the b
5055	1	a	Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.
5056	1	a	The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, does not hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.for reference xs bog on 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.
5057	0	a	Wanted to love this one so badly but did not work for me. just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though!
5058	1	a	This shirt feels amazing, it is the perfect length for leggings. i have it in long sleeves also. i do not love the pink color i bought, it looks very different from the color pictured.
5059	1	a	I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i did not get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!
5060	1	a	Beautiful shorts. make you feel like a million dollars. love love love them!the robe to match is also adorable.
5061	1	a	This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i ca not say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat
5062	1	a	Extremely well made tank top. great for work or a night out.
5063	1	a	Still ca not decide if i want to keep this. it super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black.
5064	0	a	This is a lovely cardigan--especially over dresses with leggings, over-the-knee socks, and boots. i was so ecstatic to get it at the black friday price. the description says its white but it more like a cream. it was for this reason that i initially reconsidered the purchase. i was hoping for more of an off-white or winter white as it appears on the model. except, it looked so great over dresses and suitable for the southern california winter. i did not care for the wrap belt. it just looked li
5065	0	a	I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.
5066	1	a	I ordered a sp which is normally the size i wear from retailer i'm 5ft and 129lbs. and there is so much extra material on the bottom part of the dress. it would make a beautiful summer dress if it was at least 2inches narrower on the bottom. unfortunately they are out of the xsp which would be perfect. still contemplating whether to keep or return.
5067	1	a	This sweater is amazing. color is vibrant. quality is high. but i have a super long torso and it fell short on me. if you are shorter this will be amazing. sad to send it back.
5068	0	a	I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i could not even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
5069	0	a	I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.
5070	0	a	Sadly, this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch, my purse, my necklace. i had to go home, change, and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.
5071	1	a	Exactly what i needed post pregnancy. this top is very comfortable with a drape that hides my tummy. the back hits that perfect spot where it looks great, but still hides a normal bra.
5072	1	a	I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!
5073	1	a	"I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4"". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a"
5074	1	a	"I've been searching for a pretty & soft faux fur coat - finally found it hanging there in retailer! there was only one - a size small. it looked gorgeous, but thought i could use it a bit roomier. i'm a size 2/4, 5'5"" & about 118 lbs. i ordered a medium but it was huge. stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter. lots of compliments. lightweight and luxe. get it."
5075	1	a	I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.
5076	1	a	I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i'd advise everyone to size down.
5077	1	a	Best dress ever maeve does it again! tts and can be worn all 3 seasons here in sacramento love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan!
5078	1	a	This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!
5079	1	a	Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather, i'm not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous, but the quality is just not there. very disappointing.
5080	1	a	Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch
5081	1	a	I ordered a size xl. it ran small, especially compared to other retailer xl tops. the quality of the material was great as was the embroidery. i wish it fit because i definitely would have kept it. very pretty tee.
5082	0	a	"I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress. (the closest dress pictured online to what i saw is the ""mabli maxi dress"", but imagine it opened if it had buttons, and in blue.) with"
5083	1	a	I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!
5084	1	a	Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen), but i still think it'll go with a lot.
5085	1	a	These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.
5086	1	a	This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine. details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.
5087	1	a	This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.
5088	1	a	"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5""."
5089	1	a	"I really love the look and style of these. i am not a fan of thong underwear; definitely prefer these bikini or ""hipster"" styles, but sometimes it hard to find them in attractive design. this pair is definitely attractive and i like how they fit and look a lot. i've only worn them once and they held up well for the day -- i often find lace can rip on the first wear, so i was wary. they did okay, but i do worry that they seem delicate enough i could accidentally stuck a thumb through it and rip"
5090	1	a	"So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2"" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!"
5091	1	a	This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!
5092	1	a	I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes, xs). after reading through the reviews, i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately, the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.
5093	1	a	"These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you do not see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color."
5094	1	a	"Oh my!! this dress is so cute! it fits me exactly like the pictures. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and ordered a medium. i maybe could have worn a small as well though. there is a lot of fabric to this dress, so if you're under 5'6"", it might overwhelm you! i'm 5'6"" and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel! this is s dress you can dress up or down. i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing. and pockets!! that was a nice surprise! the fabric is a little thicker, so it no"
5095	1	a	"This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2"", 135 lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly."
5096	1	a	This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.
5097	0	a	These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes, for almost $200 a pop they do not even last a full year! loved them so much, i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately, retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.
5098	1	a	"This is a cute pair of jeans. it has a slight flare and just right amount of fringe. they are super soft and and the color is slightly lighter than in photos. tts, not too low hitting right below belly button and a just the right crop length for my 5'4"" height falling ri right above my ankle."
5099	0	a	I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
5100	1	a	I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie, but the quality, fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i do not normally purchase lingerie like this, but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand, it comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it a great cut, the fabric is clearly lace, but beautifully done. and the feel is lov
5101	0	a	This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.
5102	1	a	I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band was not symmetrical,
5103	1	a	I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater, more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute, warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
5104	1	a	Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews, and because i am of short torso, but it fits well. would definitely recommend.
5105	1	a	"Absolutely love this top! yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering, especially with skinny jeans. loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and the xs fit well (falls just above my mid thigh)."
5106	1	a	It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design
5107	1	a	I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though, i wish it did come in petite, as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that did not stop me from purchasing as that an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.
5108	1	a	Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible
5109	1	a	This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.
5110	1	a	Great leggings for the price. they are ultra soft and stretchy. a great pair of leggings to relax in. they are very stretchy and only come in 2 sizes s/m, l/xl. i am 5' tall and they fit fine, because usually such generic sizing is too large for my small frame. they are a bit long for a petite person, but tucked into boots and nobody will know.
5111	1	a	I wanted to love this skirt and i agree with the other reviewers. the color of the skirt is beautiful. i've never seen anything quite like it at retailer! the quality is superb and the material is fairly substantial given the brocade design. however, the skirt made my hips look a lot bigger than they are because the shape of the skirt is more of a tulip-design. i purchased an 0 petite (because my normal size 00 petite was sold out) and while the waist part fit the hip part was disproportionately l
5112	1	a	As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.
5113	1	a	Every once in a while, i randomly pick something from the sales floor that really knocks it out of the park. print is subtle and pretty, crochet neck really lightens up the look of a long top with a lot of coverage. it cut perfectly--beautifully drapes without being so flowy it mistaken for maternity. worth full price! word of warning, i saw one top on the rack with a small amount of crochet that was unraveling, so may need to check before buying. i'm usually a size 6-8, purchased size small
5114	1	a	"This shirt looks just like it does in the picture, and my favorite detail was the buttons. i was a little disappointed in the stitching of the front tucks, as it looked sloppy at the ends, but you might find that rustic/charming. this is a great top for spring/summer. i ordered an 8p, and it fit well everywhere except the chest, so i'm returning it. my bust is about 37""(32ddd), and it was slightly too tight. if i go up a size it will probably make me look bigger than i am, nevermind the horizont"
5115	1	a	"Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets."
5116	1	a	"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear."
5117	1	a	Lightweight silk with sweet details (ruffles) fits comfortably and nice for workplace with suit or more casual.
5118	0	a	This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i did not even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.
5119	1	a	"I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4"" 112 lbs. with a slim, straight, athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they do not have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs were not cut right, i do not have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans, they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these, i ju"
5120	0	a	"5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular, knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything, the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over"
5121	1	a	I got this dress in the mail today, and it one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.
5122	1	a	Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it does not appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.
5123	1	a	Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.
5124	1	a	This is the perfect dress for going out and wearing to work (with a jacket or sweater and boots). it fits perfectly across the bust and waist and then has enough room to glide over the hips.the material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful. my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well.
5125	1	a	This dress is so pretty; can be worn casually or with heels to dress up! i get so many compliments on it, and it so comfortable, it like wearing pajamas! i highly reccomend it.
5126	1	a	How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo
5127	0	a	"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"
5128	1	a	This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems, it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings, especially since it priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered
5129	1	a	I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i could not wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket, light sweater, wedges, then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.
5130	1	a	These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i do not think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all
5131	1	a	Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!
5132	1	a	I absolutely love this blouse! it easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut wo not find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i ca not stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it sheer, so a cami is required. it also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it perfect to thro
5133	0	a	I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still did not prepare me for the sweater issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
5134	1	a	I tried this on in the navy/white combination and loved it, except it is cut rather full or large through the waist especially. if you can size it down so it fits you, you will love it. it is very soft; an easy top to throw on, feel comfy, and look fantastic! i sure wish it was smaller :/
5135	1	a	Good weight and texture to the dress but looked to tent-like for me. even taking it out of the package my first thought was, is this size mislabeled? i got a 0 but could probably have done better with 00 if those were in stock or if petite sizes were still available. returning but wish i could keep it
5136	1	a	"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i could not be more pleased."
5137	1	a	I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it, either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure, (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.
5138	1	a	I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it. the one i chose has muted earth-tone colors of tan, green, gold. looks stunning with my complexion. the blue one was nice too, but the earth tones were more flattering on me. the fit is loose and flowy, very comfortable, but not baggy. i'm 5'5, 34c, 115ish and i took my usual xs. i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall. ca not wait!
5139	1	a	"I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2""). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8"" taller it probably would have been perfect."
5140	1	a	Beautiful color and soft material but runs a little big so size down. i loved that it was complementing to my figure without making me look larger
5141	1	a	I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.
5142	1	a	"My mom pointed out this dress in the store a while back and i said ""cute, but no way i could pull that off. ""i am a short curvy and busty lady and have never been able to wear strapless dresses. i ended up ordering it for a wedding and it was a perfect fit!!! i got the petite small and the fit up top is snug but comfortable and holds the ladies in with no bra needed. amazing. the fabric is dreamy and this dress is so easily dressed up or down. hides flaws, excellent all around."
5143	1	a	I just got this in the mail, absolutely gorgeous. the hook and eye closure is very secure, i have no problem walking or sitting in this dress. i ordered a aize 8 going by the previous reviews that this dress ran small, i could have ordered my normal 6, but the 8 fits pretty good,just a tad big. the dress is more chocolate brown than black and the detail is really stunning!! you ca not find unique dresses like this anymore, truly beautiful!!
5144	1	a	"I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments."
5145	1	a	Really stretchy and therefore not a whole lot of compression. love the floral pattern and the color, but they're also surprisingly thin. they'll be good for yoga in the summer months, but i find them to be too thin to wear outside of the gym and i like a legging i can feel comfortable in running errands to and from the gym too. fit true to size.
5146	1	a	I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.
5147	1	a	I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it did not feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!
5148	1	a	Love it! ca not wait for warmer weather to wear this sassy number!i'm not sure what kind of bra to wear if any but it it fits so nicely around my bust line that it looks tasteful.
5149	1	a	"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all, but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair."
5150	1	a	I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs bigi decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.
5151	1	a	Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute. i like the look it adds. i really want to get more colors. i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small. i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.
5152	1	a	Comfy, cozy, and great bargain for the sale price.
5153	1	a	They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection, due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality, the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.
5154	1	a	Hi there, if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft, a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better), and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans, and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized, but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so, if you are ti
5155	1	a	"This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however, the fit is off. i'm 5""1, 107lbs, 32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it, if it fit properly."
5156	0	a	Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that does not fall well. also, as has happened to me before, retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it. you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out.
5157	1	a	I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.
5158	1	a	Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.
5159	0	a	It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i did not like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. it very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
5160	1	a	This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it casual yet dressy at the same time. re: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size -
5161	1	a	I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.
5162	0	a	Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.
5163	0	a	"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts, or the cut of this was not right for me, but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders did not lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
5164	1	a	This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable!for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it.
5165	1	a	I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.
5166	1	a	The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ﾃ｣ﾂｼber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v
5167	1	a	This shirt is very comfortable. though it casual, its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a littlemore edge and character. fit is slightly large. i'm 5'5'', 125 lbs and purchased the small. the arms are a little longer than i'd like and the overall fit is slightly too loose. however, it not a significant enough problem for me to return the shirt.
5168	1	a	I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it slightly loose in the body of the dress, that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i did not experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together, and the zipper was stiff so it wo not unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w
5169	1	a	This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.
5170	1	a	"I could not be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2"", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a"
5171	1	a	Walked into the retailer store in new york, while on vacation, and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it beautifully made, soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
5172	1	a	I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i did not want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it not too thin, nor see-through.
5173	1	a	Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.definitely runs big
5174	1	a	This top is lightweight and flows nice. i usually take a medium or large. i ordered a medium and it is slightly large. so if you are between sizes, i would go down. i will keep the medium because it is not the type of blouse that should hug your body. the green is stunning.
5175	1	a	Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just do not feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
5176	1	a	This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size, however, it just not long enough on me to be a top, which is what i was hoping for. i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40 style but it way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts, it shows skin. i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something. that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos. i'm still
5177	1	a	"This dress is short, but super flattering. i was surprised when i tried it on in-store that i liked it as much as i did! the lace detail around the neck is unique and beautiful. i'm 135, 5'8"", 32dd and the small fits perfectly. it easy to wear and can be dressed down with tights and boots, or dressed up."
5178	1	a	Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle
5179	1	a	I love this shirt. it is very soft and the lace on the sleeves adds an extra element. i liked this shirt so much, that i ordered a second one.
5180	1	a	This is the mid-weight fall/spring jacket i had designed for myself in my head! someone got into my head and made it! really - i could not have dreamed up a lovelier jacket. it fits like a glove, it absolutely the softest thing ever, and the (removable) lining is far warmer and plusher than i expected (i wore it out tonight on a a clear, cold night - i felt like i was wearing a hug). nice, feminine waistline and pockets in all the right places round it all out. i look forward to unbuttoning th
5181	0	a	I ordered this dress, expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large, except in the bust which fit well.
5182	1	a	"I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6""). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy"
5183	1	a	You know how sometimes you put something on and do not even have to look in the mirror to know you like it? well this is that piece of clothing. i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year. i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store. comfy, casual, not too young for my 56-year-old self, the right length, and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it. perfect on all counts.
5184	1	a	I love this dress, it very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.
5185	1	a	"I bought the m/l (5'4"",130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length, and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice."
5186	1	a	I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it was not lined i do not think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.
5187	1	a	I hesitated initially buying this because of the unique fit in the neckline and shoulders and because i have broad shoulders. but if you adjust the neck, sleeves and play with the overall fit of the shirt, it works. the boxy airy design has to be paired with something that flows with it (i.e. linen pants) or trusty denim. otherwise you may have a battle on your hands finding a complementary pairing!
5188	1	a	"I opened the package and loved this skirt immediately. i held it up and the waist is tiny. i'm usually a size 6 but sometimes go for a size 8 at retailer (i'm 5'6"" and 126 lbs). i would have needed at least 4 extra inches in the waist band to close the zipper...i wonder if this is a british size 8 or something. this 8 is closer to a 4. really disappointed."
5189	1	a	Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!
5190	1	a	This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store, but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy, i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister graduation, i paired it with a white
5191	1	a	I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.
5192	0	a	This blouse is very pretty, but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it, or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.
5193	1	a	"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also ca not wait to layer it"
5194	0	a	5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also
5195	0	a	Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this is not in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
5196	1	a	This sweater is so soft, beautiful and well made. it runs just a bit large, but i love the look.
5197	1	a	I just got this top and ca not wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side, so trust me on this! overall, i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique, comfy top for the warmer months ahe
5198	0	a	I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.overall, i would not recommend this dress for the curren
5199	1	a	"I have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports, but does not look matronly. this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece, but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful. i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good and/or support a 34ff, but gave it try because of all the 5 star reviews. i tried it on and my husband just said ""wow!"" this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports - i do not know how, but it doe"
5200	1	a	I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,i got compliments on all the looks. i think it a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. would not have paid full retail.requires ironing.i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small.
5201	1	a	I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
5202	1	a	I tried on a returned 24p in my store, they were almost the right length, but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt, and 115 lbs). they were nice though, kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey, can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low, at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top.
5203	1	a	I just need to write a review on this sweater because it the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) do not procrastinate, it worth the price.
5204	1	a	I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i do not like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t
5205	1	a	"I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors. i'm 5'7"", 120 pounds and bought the size 4 which is perfect. initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the 6 because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders. the 6 was too boxy on me and i'm so glad i went with the 4. it stretched, especially the arms, and fits perfect. i love how i can dress this down (with a graphic tee and jeans) or dress up (with a blouse and cropped black pants)."
5206	0	a	Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting. for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer. when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality. i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.
5207	1	a	Love the material and style - a very versitile skirt. however, does not fit well for those who do not look good in the slimmer looking pencil skirts.
5208	1	a	Just lovely! gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!
5209	1	a	I loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. it was a lovely dress but it fit weird on my 34 dd chest so back it goes. the zipper had one spot where it was tight, right at the widest part of my rib cage. it was fine every where else. too bad.
5210	1	a	Like the color and the dotted fabric. the length is good. the fabric on the back is a nice touch. fits well and hangs well.
5211	0	a	I purchased this dress yesterday and it cute and fits great, but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i'm keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price.
5212	1	a	"Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6"" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs, 34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest."
5213	1	a	Cute, basic top. it has really great detail at the top and it is a good length (it is not super long/too short). it does billow out a bit at the bottom, so i would size down (this is what i did after reading the previous reviews). i do not think i would have paid full price for this top, but on sale, it is a great deal and a nice addition to your wardrobe.
5214	1	a	I picked these up the other day looking for a good jeans alternative. i love them. they are the perfect fit of slim but not skinny. i went with my normal size (26) and so far after one wear, they are still in good shape. a little bit of stretch, but not too much. the moss color is so crisp and goes with a lot. they will be perfect for transitioning into fall.
5215	1	a	This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i could not be hap
5216	1	a	I love this dress it is a little sheer so nothing that spanx wo not cover. i have worn it a couple of times and have gotten many compliments.
5217	1	a	Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school
5218	1	a	This is a very pretty top with a nice flow. i love the delicate pattern. it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend.
5219	0	a	It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape did not work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it did not. also wrinkles easily.
5220	1	a	"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70 chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug"
5221	1	a	I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. was not sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.
5222	1	a	"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i did not have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i"
5223	0	a	This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
5224	1	a	"This is one of those ""why we shop at retailer dresses.""this dress arrived today - via lasership - in an actual box! both deliveries from this service far surpass fedex, ups and certainly usps which crams an expensive item in an unprotected plastic bag into the mailbox!!! okay - off my soapbox and thanks for the free shipping weekend!raspberry is quite beautiful - truly as pictured. the lacework should be more resilient than many. the shape is reigned in by the bodice (not elastic btw) and the"
5225	1	a	I debated whether or not to order this dress. i love the cut and style, but i was afraid the color would not work for me. with dark hair and pale skin, yellow tends to wash me out. i was correct, but the dress was adorable. definitely size down. i usually wear a medium or 8 in retailer dresses, but based on other reviews, i ordered this in a small. might could have used an extra small. this dress certainly wo not show off those 10 pounds you lost, but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy. als
5226	0	a	Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.
5227	0	a	Nice quality fabric and design, but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
5228	0	a	This was about to be my first retailer splurge item, but i think i'm not there yet. for the rich price tag, these pants were not going to be versatile enough for me. they're very light weight and even translucent in sunlight. perfect for a small subset of my days but not going to make the cut for casual friday. that light patch near the r knee is also a pocket- tended to flap open and look about as nonsensical as it is. if you're already on this level good for you! i had to send these back.
5229	1	a	This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.
5230	1	a	"The wash is just as pictured, and the fit is great, i actually got a 29 when i usually wear a 28 but when i wear a belt with them they hug the waist perfectly. im always on the search from 28"" length however these jeans are a 30"" and still look excellent if i roll them up once."
5231	1	a	I purchased the white in the store in a size 6. 34d. i ordered the black online in a 6 and the lining was a bit snug. (i can maybe remove the black lining) however, i really like how the peplum looks. the v neck and bra friendly design are a perfect marriage. i see wearing these through the fall with a denim jacket or cardigan. for now i am enjoying how floaty and feminine i feel. i think this is a perfect top for women with a larger chest as it gives a nice shape but does not look maternity or b
5232	1	a	I saw this in the store and fell in love with it, i did not buy it at first but i could not stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it, its soft and very comfortable, im glad i went back for it.
5233	1	a	I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out, not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it, i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i did not want it to be too short, it fits well.
5234	1	a	Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
5235	1	a	Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white, but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large, but i needed an extra large, and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy, so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.
5236	0	a	Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it
5237	1	a	This was a really nice, soft lightweight sweater, perfect for transitioning into fall. i found it to be a tad boxy and while i love a high/lo hem, it was a little short in the front for my liking. i'm still debating if i'm keeping it since i bought it full price, but the color was really pretty and on sale, i would def. go for it. for reference, i got a large since i normally like my clothes more loose.
5238	1	a	Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that flattering, feminine & fun. i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds. i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small. i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine. stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.
5239	1	a	I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.
5240	1	a	I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
5241	1	a	Here the thing: i ride horses. you would think this would mean i would love this, but the first time it came around, i hesitated simply because i spent too much of my childhood in horse-bedecked things looked overwhelmingly nerdy. but this time, having actually purchased the belted navy birds version, i had to give it a try, and it kind of a must. there is just something about the way it falls that is super flattering. it just warm enough to serve as a jacket right now (in new england) but
5242	1	a	Delayed for a month on back order, this dress was worth the wait! the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures. the length and cut is slimming, more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist. detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees. pullover style with a closed-end side zip that needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all. if your skin is sensitive--this dress is not for you. both the line
5243	1	a	Perfect for work or a night out. packing for europe, wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels. layer it after yoga got it in all colors love
5244	1	a	Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.
5245	1	a	This sweater caught my eye months ago, and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price. it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men; it has a fabulous 1960s feel to it. and, everyone loves pockets! i love the combination of peachy pink and cream, and the sweater it quite warm. the fit is good, although on me, the buttons gap slightly (this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath, as shown on the model). i'm already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations!
5246	1	a	I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who ca not give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye
5247	1	a	I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street! no kidding! this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminine/romantic quality to it. i bought size 4 and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design. this is a classic piece, that is always going to be timeless in my opinion. no regret at all to have bought it!
5248	1	a	This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!
5249	1	a	Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (5 ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!
5250	1	a	Pretty delicate lace top...love it! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips.
5251	1	a	I do not like how short it is in the back.i also prefer a solid vs. slubby material, back it goes.
5252	1	a	I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.
5253	1	a	"I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos, so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7"", 130, straight/slender build), so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit, size down. either way, get this!!!!"
5254	1	a	This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.
5255	1	a	"I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2"" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top."
5256	0	a	Designs are nice and texture feels comfortable, but sleeves are odd because they are angled.i wonder what i should do to look cool in this t-shirt.i tried wearing neutral motif, but i still felt odd.also, width is relatively wide, so it runs large.i rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelings.personally, i do not recommend this t-shirt, but who knows, it may be right for you...so, my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo
5257	1	a	The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.
5258	1	a	"I ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes. i'm 5'8"" and slender, but with a 36' bust, and the medium was too loose and long (sleeves fell past my wrists). i would exchange this for a small for a better fit, but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting. the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal - not flattering on a far-skinned blonde. i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair (as it does on the girl in the photo). the texture is great and i re"
5259	0	a	It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small
5260	1	a	I got the purple and its a lovely muted purple, almost lavender. nice quality, flattering. i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits. i'd recommend to anyone (with or without wobbly bits).
5261	1	a	Love this shirt. i have a bit of a tummy so i usually do not buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great.
5262	1	a	This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work.
5263	1	a	I ordered this sweater online in a size 12. i am 5'7 170 i normally wear a 10/12, i was swimming in this one. i could have ordered an 8 and been fine. the fabric feels luxurious but the twist in the shoulder is not sewn into place, you will have to steam/press it each time you wear it or you could have it sewed into place.
5264	1	a	"Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36"" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made."
5265	1	a	I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle is not overpowering, although i do not love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it just a little too much, but they are not visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it a good shirt.
5266	1	a	Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on
5267	1	a	I hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones. i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly. the feel is amazing - incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over!
5268	1	a	"As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125"
5269	1	a	This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.
5270	1	a	This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i did not really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a
5271	0	a	"Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the ""side breast"" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great!"
5272	0	a	I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
5273	1	a	This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!
5274	1	a	"Very cute and comfy dress. i'm 5'6"" and 117 pounds and the xs worked great. it is meant to fit big and comfy so do not expect a tailored dress. looks great with tights and boots and i love that you can turn it around to make it a cardigan!"
5275	1	a	"I purchased this blouse because i love a 70 vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors were not flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction."
5276	1	a	I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond
5277	0	a	I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
5278	1	a	This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!
5279	1	a	This dress is a marvel. it flattering and cute. it is great for work, a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer.
5280	1	a	The cheshire dress is lovely. the fit is true to size and the quality is awesome. i love the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders. i would definitely recommend this dress!
5281	1	a	The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.
5282	1	a	This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing
5283	1	a	I ordered both colors, but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous, and i agree they have a retro 70 vibe. just a tad itchy, but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance, the regular xs fit noticeably larger
5284	1	a	Soft, silky, lined in silky natural fabric, hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite, but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes, so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!
5285	0	a	These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up, the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on, too, and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are, the better stripes look. they more curvy you are, the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just is not flattering.
5286	1	a	I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.
5287	1	a	I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i do not normally like that, but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
5288	1	a	This dress is so beautiful on. purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down. material is lightweight (perfect for summer) and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine. i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size.
5289	0	a	Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless is not my best look. and i do not think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - ca not quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.
5290	1	a	Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus
5291	1	a	I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it does not cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.
5292	1	a	Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th
5293	1	a	"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless."
5294	1	a	This is the perfect dress to take traveling. dress it up with heels or down with sandals. warm up and wear it with a short black sweater. a nice easy elegant dress. size small fit nicely, medium probably would have been fine too.
5295	1	a	"These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2"" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties, which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24"". i do not know if that true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that around a 26"" inseam, but definitely a great length and i do not need to hem. the leg opening is not too big, so i can roll it up/cuff them to get"
5296	1	a	Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
5297	0	a	Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
5298	1	a	I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it a good cut for me. it not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4).
5299	1	a	Only the xxs was left, so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference, i'm 32c, 5'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color, along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable, too. love so much i, ordering more!
5300	0	a	"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise were not so short. for reference, i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips."
5301	1	a	"This coat is wonderful. it boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it was not flattering on my hourglass shape. (i am 5'6"", 34dd-27-42 and the small fit well) if you're confident enough to hide your waste, go for it. your wo not regret it."
5302	0	a	I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.
5303	0	a	"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2"", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i ca not imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i'll be returning it."
5304	0	a	I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i do not own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.
5305	1	a	The blue dress is lovely, fit true to size and a good all around, comfy dress.
5306	1	a	"When this arrived in the mail, i knew there was a 50/50 chance of a sheath dress working with my body-type (athletic on top, larger on bottom). i usually wear size 6 in a-line dresses, and i found this dress, size 6, in the sale room, and barely squeezed in. ordered size 10 and love it. (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b) the belt is adjustable, which puts everything in place. the front collar blends seamlessly into the sleeves, and the brocade panels are such a great quality of material, reminding m"
5307	1	a	Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
5308	1	a	I tried these in store, did not have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they did not have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!
5309	1	a	The jeans are flatering and stylish. they are slightly distressed but will go with anything. the fit is like other pilcro stet pants i've purchased and loved.
5310	1	a	Unlike the other reviewer, i found this skirt to run small...very small. i am pear-shaped and always wear a 12 or size 31. the size 12 in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist. another inch in the zipper would be nice! there is no spandex in this skirt - just cotton - so there is not any give to the fabric either. i ordered the size 14, which fit like a glove, but i would really like to see if the 16 would be better. embarrassing but i am just worried that with 100%
5311	1	a	This dress fits true to size. i ordered an xs like i usually wear as a small was falling off of me when i had tried on in store. the colors are more vibrant in person. it a really pretty dress and is very well made. the fabric is solid and light weight. i do not think it would work for someone with a lot of curves unless they sized up though as it is a really straight dress that is meant to lay free.
5312	0	a	The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through.
5313	1	a	Beautiful skort! true to size and very comfortable. the actual shorts part of the skort is a nice, modest length. they have the appearance of a skirt with the utility and feel of a nice pair of shorts. i ca not wait to wear it again! i am very pleased with my purchase.
5314	1	a	This is a great quality product with unique design
5315	0	a	So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~
5316	1	a	This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just could not believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6, 32 h bra)and the small was perfect. ca not wait to wear it!
5317	0	a	I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away. it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear. the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing. if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.
5318	1	a	Beautiful color; however, the fabric did not work for me. tight on top, large on bottom.
5319	1	a	I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!
5320	1	a	Cute summer/vacation dress. lightweight material but not flimsy. i'm normally a xs/s and i ordered the s petite which was right b/c i think the xs would have been too clingy looking. the regular length would also have been too long.
5321	1	a	Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
5322	1	a	"I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots."
5323	1	a	I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers.
5324	1	a	Sweater dresses are my fall/winter uniform and the patterns on this one are particularly unique and lovely. i'm 5'2'' with a small bust, this fit nicely and moves well, it not baggy or bulky and not tight. good for work and play. i would usually wait to see if an item at this price goes on sale, but this one is the kind of piece that i expect to be snapped up swiftly and i do not regret getting it at full price.
5325	1	a	"I recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type. the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed. my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively, causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy. if your body is more like the model, this is a flattering dress. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140# and ordered the medium petite. perhaps if i bought the non-petite version or sized down maybe it will"
5326	1	a	First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.
5327	0	a	I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.
5328	0	a	Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes do not come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i ca not imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went.
5329	1	a	I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it. i love the tassel on the back at the tie. the fabric is not too sheer. the fit is loose and will be cool this summer.
5330	1	a	These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!
5331	1	a	These are great, but unfortunately ran small for me in comparison to my other pilcro jeans. i returned and the size i need is sold out now.
5332	1	a	I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you do not really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it is not a symmetrical look. i actually lik
5333	0	a	This shirt was on sale, and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap!
5334	0	a	I really wanted this skirt to work but it did not look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!
5335	1	a	This can take you from office to casual afternoon. i got the plaid print in store. it is much nicer in person than in the picture. very cute neckline and detailing. i'd say true to size, slightly large. i wore my regular size and it fits fine without looking too large.
5336	1	a	"These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that the size i got. the material has some give but does not stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"", they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable."
5337	1	a	I love this to throw over leggings, covers your butt. great fabric and quality. i bought white and gray, after they arrived i knew i needed a black one, but, sadly, it does not come in black :(i ordered xs, and it roomy. size down for sure.
5338	1	a	Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however, this shirt did not work for me. i think it a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size, but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model, and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
5339	1	a	I made a visit to the store specifically to try on this dress and it was a disappointment for me. i tried on size 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and i could not zip the dress up half way. the zipper is on the side, but it more to the back which i have to stretch my arms all the way back to reach it. it stopped at my waist and was too tight for me to zip up anymore. i tried on an 8 regular and the entire dress was huge. (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i like the regular size because the l
5340	0	a	I love this maxi dress. it is fitted up top and very maxi like on the bottom. it was to much fabric for me, the dress made me look heavier than i am. i am 5'9' and 160. i fit in the medium. the dress just did not do anything for my body type - curvy. i think you need to be fairly lean to look nice in this dress. sadly, i had to return. maeve makes great maxi, unfortunately they do not fit me correctly.
5341	1	a	"This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer! gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind! i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it. runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear. you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top. i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!"
5342	1	a	I just wore these and they were comfortable and did not stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these did not do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.
5343	0	a	"I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this ""dress"". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said ""are you kidding me?!"" by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i do not know which dress the"
5344	1	a	"This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i ca not wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin, and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also, it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7""). other than that, i love this dress."
5345	1	a	Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..
5346	1	a	"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it does not show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3"
5347	1	a	This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you wo not regret it!
5348	1	a	Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.
5349	1	a	This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. ca not wait to wear!
5350	1	a	"Based on other reviews i had no doubt this dress would be perfect. it truly is a work of art, however it just was not ""me"" when i tried it on. i'm sure for others it will be perfect. my biggest issues were the sheerness of the top portion, which is obvious in the photos. i was hoping it would be less obvious in person. also the elbows of the dress were tight, so it was difficult to bend my arms, and i have pretty slender arms."
5351	1	a	Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on, but can be worn in a versatile way, and if you are small chested, without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material, i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!
5352	1	a	Following the advice of other reviews, i ordered a size larger than normal, since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere, including the bust.the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
5353	1	a	This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price, but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest, but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest, so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
5354	1	a	I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.
5355	0	a	Thought this would be a great dress for warm days, but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8, usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape, this is a great dress with nice detailing, but sadly the shape did not work for me.
5356	1	a	Comfy, but constantly picking pills off of it, from first wear.
5357	1	a	"As others have mentioned, they're quite long. i'm 5'8"" and need to wear 2"" heels to make sure these do not drag. they're much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles."
5358	0	a	This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.
5359	1	a	I wanted to really love this because it a bit more styled than a plain tank, but the front and back both poof out and i felt like i was wearing a maternity top. just did not do my body any justice....loved the top and that part fit great, but the bottom part was too poofy and sadly not a good look at all on me.
5360	0	a	Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
5361	1	a	"I originally bought this for myself but it was way too big on my backside since i do not have much ""junk in the trunk."" i decided to pass it on to my sister since it was just too pretty to return. it fits her much better and she worn it on a few occasions. it does run larger and the pants are very long. definitely have to be either hemmed or always worn with heels."
5362	0	a	This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
5363	1	a	This is a lovely sweater--unique, nicely made, though i found that it ran large for me. i was between a size xs and small, and neither one seemed just right so i ended up returning it. the small had the right length in the arms and torso, but was too wide in the torso and shoulders, and the xs was too short. bummer! also found that every single ivory one had stains or spots on them in my local store, not sure why. if i had been able to settle on the right size i probably would've kept it!
5364	0	a	I am 6' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h), so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top, i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine, but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is, it is very cute otherwise! i just mail
5365	0	a	Fabric felt and looked cheap. hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same.
5366	1	a	Just not my style. it is light and the color is lovely and summery. but the cut of the sweater just did not work at all for me. and it was not overly soft - though that would not have mattered if it fit me better.
5367	1	a	I just tried this top in red in xs and i think it cute. it fairly fitted in my opinion; the sleeves are pretty snug but there stretch to them. i was fine with the fabric and the size xs (i'm ~105 lbs, 34aa) even though sometimes i fit better in xspetite. the only downside is that the washing instructions say to remove the tie before machine washing, and i guess that put me off a little (the idea of re-lacing it every time). so i have not yet bought it. the red is vibrant, tomato red and the
5368	1	a	I tried these on in the store and did not buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i could not stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
5369	0	a	I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just was not right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.
5370	1	a	Very comfortable and stylish. can wear with tights, as a dress, or over jeans. cute any way! the material is not super thick, but not too thin.
5371	1	a	Top feels like pajamas but looks very classy. the sweater material is so soft. i wear it with a blazer over the top and i get so many compliments on it. wish they had it in more colors! must have!
5372	1	a	Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length would not be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique, by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and, subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.
5373	1	a	"This is a darling dress! it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders. unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest. i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body. i'm 5'4"", 118 lbs. wish i could have kept this one!"
5374	1	a	This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i do not plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem
5375	1	a	I'm a little hesitant about the dropped-hem style but this drapes so well and looks utterly chic. i wore it to a poetry reading with some fluevogs and it not only looked good but it felt like i was wearing nothing. the material is beautifully soft and i love this particular shade of blue. will definitely be wearing this a lot.
5376	1	a	True to size and lovely colors. bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.
5377	1	a	Comfy. i bought the moss color i really like it. great causal pant for spring and summer
5378	0	a	I really wanted to love this romper and could not wait to try it on. it super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist. if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice, but if it sits at my natural waist, the back balloons out and it unflattering. it too bad, i love the print and ease of this design.
5379	1	a	I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small.
5380	1	a	To my knowledge this dress looks great on everyone. the fabric is light and of moderate quality, the finishing is acceptable. a great basic.
5381	1	a	Beautiful dress, can be dressed up or down. runs just a bit large, but if i had sized down it would have been too tight in the bust (38d). i normally wear a medium and the medium was perfect in the chest. the color is absolutely gorgeous and i love the length - i do not like dresses that show my knees. my only complaint is that a dress that is this expensive even on sale should have better quality control. mine made it to me without a button at the the back. not a huge deal, but it wo not be easy
5382	1	a	My favorite features of this sweater are the flattering neckline and the bracelet length sleeves. it a heavy-weight cotton with a beautiful line. my only complaint is that it seems to pick up lint and things very easily and needed a lint roller even straight out of the delivery box. still, a small issue for an easy to wear sweater that looks great with jeans and boots as well as leggings. a new favorite!
5383	1	a	Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who do not usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.
5384	1	a	Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.
5385	1	a	The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!
5386	1	a	Very feminine, fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.
5387	1	a	This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy, soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a weater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $
5388	1	a	I adore this little sweater- the pictures do not do it justice. i'm tall, with broad shoulders and small chest- the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering. colors work with denim or any neutral, and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer.
5389	1	a	"This dress is crazy flattering and extremely versatile. i wish it came in other colors...i would scoop them all up. great price (plus used by birthday 15% off coupon). the fabric is light weight...but not flimsy. plus it lined with a satin fabric so the dress wo not stick to you. i'm 5"" 113 and i ordered the petite x-small and it is perfect. i can see it with fun sneakers (like the picture) or with some fun jewelry and high wedges for going out. thinking of buying a 2nd one as back up...it th"
5390	1	a	Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it a staple and keeper.
5391	1	a	This skirt is stretchy and really comfortable. i love the color. the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly- on me at least. very flattering for the behind though.
5392	1	a	I usually do not do jumpsuits because i'm 6 ft tall and the torso is usually too short. i saw this one in a store though and decided to try it on. it very light and soft cotton and fit great lengthwise! overall, the fit is way too large though. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i was swimming in the xl - as in the waistband was at least 4 inches too big. the back of the waistband has elastic so if you are not sure what size to get, size down. i got a size l and it still a bit too big - the back
5393	1	a	Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it does not look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.
5394	1	a	Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper...
5395	1	a	As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it, and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it longer in back, has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it long enough to wear with leggings, but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights, but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com
5396	1	a	I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.
5397	1	a	Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.
5398	1	a	The embroidery grabbed my attention, but i loved the way it felt once i tried it on. the fit is loose (i'm between a small and medium and the small was a bit loose), but still flattering. i really love everything about it, even the lighter weight fabric. i live in the south were fall and winter tend to be on the warmer side. the v-neck is just perfect. i can see wearing this to work as well as out - one of the most versatile dresses i've found lately!
5399	1	a	I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!
5400	1	a	This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me, since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely.
5401	1	a	Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.
5402	1	a	Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.
5403	1	a	I was on the fence about this top, because i do not typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
5404	1	a	This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item, totally worth it.
5405	0	a	"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo."
5406	0	a	It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really did not live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3, 115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom, a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
5407	0	a	Although i love retailer, this product is not the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric was not soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
5408	0	a	This top is beautiful aesthetically, and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out, so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.however, i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me, which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt, which looked nice. however, the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s
5409	0	a	I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i do not think it worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!
5410	1	a	I love this dress, is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.
5411	1	a	This dress has really great features--the style is adorable, and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i do not like about it is that it a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.
5412	0	a	I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went.
5413	1	a	I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium
5414	1	a	This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain, long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light, so it is for fall or spring.
5415	1	a	I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.
5416	1	a	This a great dress! bright colors, soft material and comfortable! the body of the dress is voluminous, so i found it to be a definite swing dress. i can see why it sold out the first time it was offered!
5417	1	a	Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !
5418	1	a	Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!but as others have stated, the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.
5419	1	a	It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.
5420	1	a	This is a beautiful dress and fits well. the embroidery is delicate and can snag easily.
5421	1	a	The cut, design, and fit were great on this top. however, a few people have written reviews that the top is not see-through. that was not my experience. the top was very sheer and even a nude bra was clearly outlined in it. sadly that was a deal breaker for me and i had to return it. also, on a side note i do not appreciate receiving a garment in the mail from an online order that already had make-up stains on the collar. so just watch out for that.
5422	1	a	I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.
5423	1	a	This dress worked well on me (not too curvy). it fitted and enhances curves in a nice way. the patterns looked nice, too.
5424	1	a	This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.
5425	1	a	I tried on the xs in store, but ti was a little big on me (and i usually get petite in dresses, unless they are mini dresses).so i decide to order the xxs petite. it fits much better. the length is, at the highest point, just above my knees. the chest part fits better on me as xxs p, the plunge is not low, not too high, and is flattering, i can wear a regular bra that can attach as t-back and you wo not see anything. the model on the picture is what it looks like as a usual size (so xs instea
5426	1	a	I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
5427	1	a	This dress is absolutely stunning. i did agree with other reviewers that the skirt is very full. i had it taken in, and it fits exactly like the model.
5428	1	a	This top is soft, flattering, modest enough to wear to work, but subtly sexy (and i'm amply endowed at 36d). i just wish i'd gotten one in every color.
5429	1	a	This is a great dress, i feel like it hides any imperfect spots including some armpit fat or belly fat. i have gotten several compliments on this dress because the stitching for the flowers is very high quality!
5430	1	a	Such a fun jacket! great to wear in the spring or to the office as an alternative to a formal blazer. very comfortable!
5431	1	a	I am curvy on bottom. i am 5ft 9 and this is very long. it ok to wear with jeans or leggings and the longer tunics are stylish these days. however it long enough to be a dress. i bought a large my usual size. i gave it 4 stars because it is sized bigger then a large.it is 100% cotton so maybe it will shrink a little. i am ok with it though. it is very loose and a relaxed fit. the embroidery on the neckline has pretty little beadwork all over the stitching. very cute detail. i love the patter
5432	1	a	And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....
5433	1	a	This top was always on my wait for sale list, now it is and i had to pass. i love the look on other people, the laec up is super cute and trendy, but the cut was just too big on me. it left me blah. i think if you are tall and are looking for a nice white shirt, then go for it, it looks so nice half tucked with skinny jeans...
5434	1	a	Love my jeans, fit great and very flattering. they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit. receive compliments every time i wear them. if they go on sale i will buy another. :)
5435	1	a	Had not really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store. so i tried it on. i'm only 5'1 and 140 lb. busty on top so i tried the 8. it was a smidge snug, decided since the dress has no give to go with a 10. would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length, but it back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation. its just above my ankles in regular length, which will work and i can up the score with some wedges. this dress fits like a dream and
5436	1	a	I have never written a review on retailer before, but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online, i felt i had a duty to review it. it is gorgeous! i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it. the fabric is light pink with a shimmer. the flower detailing is so feminine and soft. the back closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing. i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be
5437	1	a	I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year. i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed, but not baggy. they are very flattering. i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well. i was them in cold water, delicate cycle, hang to dry and they are good to go. they have held up well - even the ones that are 2+ years old are still going strong with no holes or tears.
5438	1	a	I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
5439	1	a	I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.
5440	1	a	The stitching is why i like this dress. even though the arms and waist were a little large on me, i decided to keep it because of the beautiful pattern. (i think going a size down from what i normally wear would be too tight across my back or too short.) i will wear it with a cardigan, tights, and boots as the weather gets cooler.
5441	1	a	I love this dress. the quality of the material is very nice - good weight and softness. the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on. i got tons of compliments when i wore it!
5442	1	a	This sweater jacket is perfect.it is gorgeous, casual, unique and a closet must have!i wore it for the first time to an nhl game with black jeans and a red tee and got tons of compliments.it is a medium weight knit and so works well under a jacket in the cold winter months, will be perfect for early springas a stand alone jacket, and also in early fall!a beautiful basic with a pretty accent ruffle that is sophisticated and adds just that little something special!it runs true to size, with
5443	1	a	"This tunic is true to size, i ordered the xxs as i am 5'5"", 110 lbs. it fit perfectly and hit me about 4 inches above the knee. similar to model photo (i have long torso). it has a very sparingly done cluster of sparkle sequence. the draw string waist has a tie on each side to adjust length. i actually returned it only because it seemed a little to young a look for me. i was sorry to do so."
5444	1	a	I loved this dress immediately. i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt. only one complaint. it a bit short on one side so i'll have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights (if i want to wear it to work).
5445	1	a	I love this jumpsuit. it unique, comfortable and fits true to size. you can dress it up or down depending on the event. every time i wear it i get loads of compliments!
5446	1	a	I love this top, the beachy print is very cute. my only complaint is that it does run large, it is definitely not a fitted t-shirt; and bought the medium and it a little baggy on me. i'm hoping that a wash and dry will shrink it up a bit. if not, that okay, still very cute.
5447	1	a	I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size, and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy, but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.
5448	0	a	Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
5449	1	a	"I bought this in navy, medium, after looking at it online and reading all of the reviews. i am so glad i did. it hangs beautifully, and i have worn it nearly every day since it arrived. i am 5'3"", and 34 dd on top, with narrow shoulders and a short torso, so not easy to fit. this is very well made, and a medium to heavy cotton perfect for spring and foggy evenings in california. in fact i am wearing my new sweater over my friday casual tee at work today. if you ware hesitating the purchase at co"
5450	1	a	I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it quite thin. it is not sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.
5451	1	a	Nice thick fabric, lays well. sleeves three quarter but looks great on.
5452	0	a	The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
5453	0	a	This dress is so pretty and the fabric is tightly woven so that it wo not stretch as much as other sweater dresses. i am disappointed in the sleeves though. the cut is way below the armpit so that when you raise your arms, it pulls tight and is uncomfortable. for the price, and the amount of time i wanted to wear it, it not worth keeping. another thing is that the fabric is tightly woven so if you are cold natured and ok with the sleeve issue, this is the dress for you. however, if you are hot
5454	1	a	This blouse makes me feel young, vibrant, and beautiful! i got it in (2) colors with the coupon special. i love how it fits and it slimming! love it. i have broad shoulders, and it is very slimming.
5455	1	a	Wow this is a keeper. love how soft and special the color feels. the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear. not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted. love it with jeans since the back ends at waist.
5456	1	a	The dress is lovely, but the sizing is off. the tag from retailer said it was a large, my usual size, but the manufacturer size was an 8. too small, so i will have to return it.
5457	1	a	Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap
5458	1	a	This top would have been better if it had a stretchy fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.
5459	1	a	I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i
5460	1	a	Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i do not think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it a hight-quality piece.
5461	1	a	I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.on one hand, i like it; on the other hand, there are some minor things i do not like.first, i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.second, i like a soft color of this cardigan.on website pictures, two motifs look almost the same.in reality, brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.third, texture.this cardigan is made of linen and cotton, so it feels comfortable to wear.if there are flaws
5462	1	a	I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.
5463	1	a	I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy. i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.
5464	0	a	The shape was not as nice on model, seemed like a lot of extra material.
5465	1	a	"I've had this dress for a while now and waited to write a review, glad i did. i originally ordered the mp, 5'5"" 130 lbs. while it looked nice - accentuated my waist it was a bit big in the chest area. it probably would have been ok but i am picky about fit. after debating for awhile i ordered the sp and it fits much better! when i pulled it out of the package i was worried it was too short but it not. it hits right above my knee. in fact i compared both dresses and there is not much of a diffe"
5466	1	a	"I got 2 of these dresses, one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 51 and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7"" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it p"
5467	0	a	"First of all i need to state that i am 5,1"". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel, it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan, there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c"
5468	1	a	Quite cute, it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.
5469	1	a	The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!
5470	1	a	"I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.on the other hand, the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
5471	1	a	I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty
5472	1	a	Love it. got a lot of compliments with it.buy it, it worth it especially with the sale price right now.
5473	1	a	"I purchased this sweater in the blue and i love the color. at first i bought the regular size extra small. i am 5/2"" and 102 pounds. i had to return the xs for the xxs petite. i like the arms to be long so i do not usually purchase sweaters in the petite sizes, but this one in the xxs petite the arms are still plenty long enough. it is still very roomy. it is very soft and comfortable, slightly itchy, i wear a very thin long sleeve shirt underneath."
5474	1	a	I love this - great coverage, goes with everything, flattering pockets, soft and soothing taupey gray palette - a+. retailer does it again.
5475	0	a	Lovely cut, pretty creamy color, great top for strong shoulders, however. the upper section of this top is way more sheer than it appears in the photos. there is no bra that would really work with it--unless you want to embrace the undergarment visibility and go with one that has really pretty straps. just be sure the bra fits especially well, because any back fat will absolutely show. if you go without a bra, though: headlights. so there that.
5476	1	a	I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great, the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.
5477	1	a	This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i ca not wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! do not wait too long before this one sells out.
5478	0	a	When i read car coat, i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin, long blazer. also, the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe, so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected, so it will be a return.
5479	1	a	Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering, unique, and compliment grabbing skirt. it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear. this is my 10th skirt of hers and i love them all.
5480	1	a	"Love this dress! it sooo pretty. i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it petite. i bought a petite and am 5'8"". i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee. would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite."
5481	1	a	This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!
5482	1	a	I love this skirt so much. it so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it not see-through in anyway. it a great buy.
5483	1	a	A comfortable shirt that has a touch of dressy to it.
5484	1	a	I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!
5485	1	a	"Love the colors in this autumn designed sweater that i just received but it has to be returned. i disagree with one of the reviews that it is not as pictured as far as the green being ""off."" i think it is just as pictured. i love the texture of the large pockets and belt with the suede feel. i love the flap on the back. what i do not like is how large it is. i have never worn an xs from retailer and i should have listened to the advice from the previous reviews but i did not. i could send it back"
5486	1	a	"This dress is really beautiful, cheerful, the color lovely, the fabric soft and beautiful. i wish it had worked with my body because i really liked the style, fabric, and color. i am 5' 5"" with long legs and a shorter upper body, so i needed to buy this dress in a petite size, but they were sold out of petite smalls and mediums. so i tried the small in a regular size. the armscye (depth of arm hole) is so low that my breast was completely revealed! i thought about shortening the straps entirely"
5487	0	a	I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately, the cut is different. the sides, covered here by the model hands, flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i do not own anything else high-wasted, being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt
5488	1	a	Beautiful top! had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose. it will look great with dark jeans and mules!
5489	1	a	"We always hope that the dress looks just like it is pictured i would say that this dress is more of an emerald green rather then a paler mint green . that said it is very forgiving stylewise because it does not cling and show your lumps and bumps . however the material is very thin like a sheet. length is good it is right to the knee on my 5'3"" frame. armholes are well positioned and not too big as to show bra or undergarments .not so sure how it would hold up over an evening or afternoon wea"
5490	1	a	If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++ first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person.....
5491	1	a	I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy, but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they do not hold up, i love them that much.
5492	1	a	I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.
5493	1	a	"This is a lovely dress, the shape is really flattering and it light and easy to wear. the only problem i have is it runs a little big - i'm normally a 6-8 and i'm sizing down to a 4. otherwise it pretty perfect, the length is good for taller women (i'm 5'11"") and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes wo not need a bra. definitely recommend this!"
5494	1	a	I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,
5495	1	a	This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look, or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed, but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy, i highly recommend!
5496	1	a	The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath
5497	1	a	Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size, even for an oversized piece. order a size down, even if you want a boxier look. unsure how the fabric will hold up-but if it does it will be a great get.
5498	1	a	The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it, the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of
5499	1	a	"The sweater coat is a must try on! it a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers)."
5500	0	a	I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived, however, they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly, the pants are, in actuality, quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height, if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly, the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what shown, although the width of the pant legs may have
5501	1	a	I love the green pattern. the fabric hangs and moves beautifully. thick enough to cover undergarments without slip or liner. ballet back is nice detail. i'm curvy and generally between s and m, s has a little room to spare. generally flattering piece. great for summer!
5502	1	a	I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot, the color is highly versatile, it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm, and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan, likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to
5503	0	a	"When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however, when i examined it and proceeded to try it on, i was really disappointed. the quality is ok, but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d,109lbs, 5'0""). the bottom part fit. sadly, not impressed. this one is going back :("
5504	1	a	This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well, too, and during cooler seasons, i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material
5505	1	a	It a sweatshirt that is not typically sweatshirt looking. first, it spacedye. then there the hi-lo hem. it mock neck and it wide neck. sleeves are low and cocoon-y. it oversize in looks but not overwhelming. i love that i can throw this on over jeans or leggings, step into a pair of flats or trainers, whip my hair up into a bun and head out without looking too sloppy.
5506	1	a	I love these pants - they are very soft but the linen is thick and high-quality.
5507	1	a	"I love this sweater. i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length. the overall fit was the same. i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue. i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment. this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile. it might just be my go to fall sweater."
5508	1	a	Bought this on a whim, cocoon sweaters usually do not work for me. this cardigan is very cute, more of a dark gray. if it they carry again, grab it!
5509	1	a	This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it does not balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.
5510	1	a	This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you wo not find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order did not show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!
5511	1	a	This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy, but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!
5512	1	a	I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice, a little heavier and more formal.
5513	1	a	The arm holes are a little large but not to a point i can not deal with them! it hits just at the right place on my body and is very flattering. i love the print and it is going to be a staple with jackets and alone!!
5514	1	a	The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
5515	1	a	The colour is gorgeous but it basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.
5516	1	a	"This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large, i am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. and wore a 2 petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy. i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around, dancing, hugging, buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully."
5517	1	a	"This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect, the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue, very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition."
5518	1	a	"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)"
5519	0	a	This is a lovely skirt that fits well, but it is much more of a yellowy cream color than white. also, it felt very static-y.
5520	0	a	I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding, and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen. for an almost $300.00 dress, the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.
5521	1	a	"I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i was not sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5""3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas."
5522	0	a	This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
5523	1	a	I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but had not tried it on yet. i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale - $40 for maeve?? it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years.
5524	1	a	I did not realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it super cute.
5525	1	a	These are the best tights! last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband. this year the best waistband tights are best!
5526	1	a	"This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it, it now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5""6"" frame, so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant, a little chanel like. and by the way, the belt is included, as another reviewer"
5527	1	a	Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which is not as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.
5528	1	a	I normally wear a large to medium but due to other reviews i ordered a med and could've worn a small. i still love it and i'm so glad i ordered.
5529	1	a	"I received these pants today and they're perfect. as another reviewer stated, ""i would definitely not wear these for lounging"" you can dress them up or down. i feel like these will be my favorite go-to pants this spring. i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect"
5530	0	a	I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.
5531	1	a	Comfortable and flows well, does run large, order one size smaller.
5532	0	a	The material is thin and of poor quality. it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
5533	1	a	I've been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one! it so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it. perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask.
5534	1	a	I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect.
5535	0	a	Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i do not even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
5536	1	a	I purchased this top in the blue stripe and red. after washing the red top, it lost color in little spots and also has little holes along the seams. the blue washed fine. overall, it is a very cute top and great for summer.
5537	1	a	"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i do not know why it not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats."
5538	1	a	Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.
5539	0	a	This top has dry clean only. did not like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. do not.
5540	1	a	I love this swimsuit - the color, the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me, but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that, although the backside looks great, there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit, this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.
5541	1	a	I love this top! the fit is perfect and i particularly like the longer back. there is a split between the shorter front and longer back which is brilliant so you can move and sit without it pulling around your bum. looks great with skinny jeans or with leggings. it is very light weight and is perfect for spring. the sleeves are slightly fitted and very comfortable. the quality and construction is great. i am 5 feet and got a petite xs which is perfect.
5542	1	a	The lilac pic of this shirt does not do it justice......it is so darn cute on! the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small.... love that!!! also, the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty! the fabric is like a washed cotton.....very soft. i can see this being dressed up or made really casual.....i bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt!
5543	1	a	This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
5544	1	a	This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup). in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf
5545	1	a	"So i was not sure about ordering this skirt because i could not see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and does not look or feel cheap. the color is not blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the"
5546	1	a	"I agree with the other reviewer on the slimming effect of this tunic and ca not wait til the weather warms up so i can wear it. i'm 5' 5""/140lbs and the 6 was a perfect fit. one thing i did not notice in the images, at least not the main image, is that the slits on the side at the hip are pretty high. not a problem, but just something i had not noticed. also, for me, i was not too sure about the color combo initially but it works in person."
5547	0	a	This dress was sooo cute online and in the store - i hands down would have bought it but i had an extra few minutes so i decided to try it on- terrible! the dress looked awakward on me- the strings lacing strings had town on a few spots and it just was not flattering for a curvy girl. now i know why there were so many in the store! which is a rarity for my location.
5548	1	a	I ordered my normal size large and am sadly returning because it overly large and long on my frame. the slight dolman sleeves are too long and wide and better suited for longer arms than mine. love the pointelle sleeves. they add a soft feminine vibe. hard to tell from the photos, but the texture is almost fuzzy. the gray color is beautiful and its actually made from multi colored beige and gray that looks silver in the light. it does not itch or shed. i do not like it enough to try a smaller
5549	1	a	This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted, with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously, the blue is sold out till may. this can b
5550	1	a	I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.
5551	0	a	I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i did not find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest did not look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it did not look as good on me.
5552	1	a	The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.
5553	0	a	This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i did not even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and would not buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.
5554	1	a	I like this raincoat but it runs large. exchanging for a smaller size.
5555	1	a	Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.
5556	1	a	I loved wearing this outside on a hot day! the fabric is a nice quality. you ca not tell in the photos, but it is a jersey/knit fabric. the color labeled red that looks orange is actually coral. it a nice color. i usually wear a true size 2, and that what i ordered, but i found that it is slightly big. i can wear it, but would have preferred half a size to a full size smaller. a versatile dress that you can wear often!
5557	1	a	The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional. the pattern/coloring is even more beautiful in person. overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in.
5558	1	a	Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer, but with a nude bra you ca not tell at all), so it great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape, and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could've possibly gone with a 0, but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove
5559	1	a	"Love, love, love!this is true retailer! from the style to the mix of sweater types and the ""surprise"" pleats in back! i wore it for the first time yesterday and received compliments all day! so glad i bought two colors!"
5560	1	a	This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.
5561	1	a	"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it a gorgeous shade of blue (denim, not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i wo not be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material, it an interesting blend bc it is not soft or rough. some may say it itchy and some may say it soft, to me it is not either. it merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible, ""it"
5562	1	a	This is a closet staple! loose fitting, but lovely. well made!
5563	1	a	Hands-down one of the more comfortable shirts i've purchased from retailer.
5564	1	a	I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra would not show.
5565	1	a	I bought the sweater in nude, and it fits perfectly. it is so much better than a standard cardigan- it has beautiful details. its drapes so well across your body, and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully. i wear this to work, but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits- its very versatile.
5566	1	a	Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats, and thick enough that you do not have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband is not secured, so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!
5567	1	a	I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :)
5568	0	a	I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank, and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad.
5569	1	a	I thought this top was absolutely beautiful online, and it does not disappoint in person. the fabric is divine, and i just love the paisley design. after putting it on though, it did look just a tad boxy, but not enough to return it. i would definitely recommend the top, and maybe a cute belt to accompany!
5570	0	a	I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
5571	0	a	I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it a very pretty top.cons: there a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
5572	1	a	I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it on-line. the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining. the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather. this is great with any shoe type. very versatile year round piece alone or under layers. should be good for all body types.
5573	1	a	I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out. great buy! especially on sale ;)
5574	1	a	I bought the ivory sweater. lovely color and softness. the zipper is a great, unique feature that i love. the bottom has a wavy shape with extra fabric - definitely creates a bell shape.
5575	1	a	I am inspired to sit in front of a roaring fire, sipping tea, with the dogs at my feet, in this sweater. or roaming the moors. the cashmere is thick, luxurious, and soft. there is a cable detail that runs along the large wooden buttons and also the pockets, (decent sized pockets to stash a hanky, while roaming the moors). the fit is on the large size and boxy. if i had to nit pick, i would say that the length could be a tad longer. the sweater does not have complete derriﾃ｣ﾂｨre coverage. i am 5?5?
5576	1	a	Love the patterns and the length. i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. it really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!
5577	1	a	These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.
5578	0	a	"Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7"", 34c, 28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size, meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands), but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit, and are made of a great weighty denim, with very little stretch, the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash, all the lines butterfly"
5579	1	a	So i thought this sweater would be snowy white, but it actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it unattractive, i do like it, just because it is not snowy white like i thought, it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
5580	1	a	Absolutely love these leggings - warm, comfortable - great way to relax after a long day? snuggle up in these...do stretch even longer after a while, but wash and wear again is easy - even wear out of the house...bought in green and love how well they go with sweaters, shirts, etc. -
5581	1	a	I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i do not think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i was not wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it did not flow over my hips as well because it so long. i think
5582	1	a	This is very cute. it lined, it smocked. it longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees, which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!
5583	1	a	Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.
5584	1	a	I wish i had sized up on this one. you ca not tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line
5585	1	a	"I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape, feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2"" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and did not notice a major difference width wise. i typi"
5586	1	a	Great sweater coat. fits a bit large. purchased a small...which is unusual for me. i normally wear a medium or sometimes a large. retailer clothes are mosly cut small. it looks great on...warm, comfy and attractive. i am very pleased with this purchase. highly recommend.
5587	1	a	Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comfortable
5588	0	a	"This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look."
5589	1	a	Fabric is soft,cool and comfortable. love the sleeves as air circulates. this is perfect for new wide legs i purchased. many compliments and purchase inquiry when worn. purchased in two colors.
5590	1	a	So i ordered a 0 and p0. when i received them i could tell right away that i'd prefer the 0 and it looked to be the perfect size. then i tried to slip it on over my shoulders...it was tight. it was the right size but it was so hard to get on over my shoulders and then to take it off i needed my husband help. it fit great otherwise. i loved the feel of the fabric...the design of the bodice. going up a size would not help me as then it would be too large in the bust area...i'm a 32b but i do hav
5591	1	a	"Love the color, fit and feel of these jeans. the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i did not have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party. they did not bag out after the first wearing and are true to size. i got a 27p (5'2"", 115#). the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle. the rise was not too low for me. highly recommend!"
5592	0	a	This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you ca not live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.
5593	1	a	Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however, when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back, so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order has not even shipped and the rep could not tell me when/if it would.
5594	1	a	I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big, so between true to size and big. it is both flattering and stretchy. the waist comes in nicely, the sleeves are not annoying, and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion. length was right above the knee.just. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist for reference...
5595	1	a	This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .
5596	1	a	"I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0"" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long, even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo."
5597	1	a	This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.
5598	1	a	These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy, and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic, which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist, so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that, their silky material give them the ill
5599	1	a	"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i do not have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase."
5600	1	a	This is such a soft, comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!
5601	1	a	I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it! no, it not lined but it not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!
5602	1	a	I loved the look and style of the dress but was unsure how it would work with my body. i'm curvy but slim and usually a size 6 or 8 in retailer. i went with the m in the navy color, and i'm happy i did! the floral pattern is vibrant and the ruffled skirt is flirty and fun. as far as fit goes, i'd say this runs mostly true to size but is rather short in length. i have a large chest so the top part looked more baggy than blousy, and the skirt portion was just comfortably fitted. however, the cuten
5603	1	a	Quality is great, fits very well at waste, i am 5'4 135lb bought size 8p and it good... i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor. they are more fall/spring/winter pants as material quite thick. overall, i am happy with them
5604	1	a	This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it not as see-through as other tees i've seen.
5605	1	a	Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
5606	1	a	The fabric is beautiful, the embroidery quite striking, and the length is perfect. however, the dress is a bit amorphous; and as others have mentioned, the sleeves are silly. so i took the dress to my favorite seamstress, and she added a couple of darts in the back and fixed the sleeves - voila!. these were not expensive fixes, and now the dress is perfect.
5607	1	a	"I was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft, casual cotton feel. i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem. i'm 5'5"" 120 (34c) and the small hits right at my hips, so it not to short or too long. i often wear an xs in tops and i did not even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right. with the cutout detailing, i'll hand wash this. i hope it holds up."
5608	1	a	Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer past, and i love it to bits! i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.(it true that this sweater is not lined, but to my mind, it would be a crime
5609	1	a	Lovely style. i got the navy color and it beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i do not know if it had been worn and returned or if it just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well, i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
5610	1	a	As beautiful as in the picture. could not go wrong with it. excellent quality and gorgeous color.
5611	0	a	The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men cut jeans.
5612	1	a	Ordered my regular size 27. they were tight when they arrived but they stretch - a lot. i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear.
5613	1	a	I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color. the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black. maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses. i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms. the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!
5614	0	a	Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure, and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
5615	0	a	"The color says red but it more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.finally returned it without it making it out the door :("
5616	1	a	This shirt looks and feels fabulous. i got black and white and received a ton of compliments. wore with boots and leggings and fun jewelry.
5617	0	a	Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it, it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found. the fit is nice but i would not buy it due to the material being too delicate.
5618	1	a	"I love the color and the design of this pant....looks very bohemian. it runs large and it has sort of a ""short"" inside of it that is made of a silky polyester...so, it not as ""loose"" on the inside as you would think. this ""short"" is not a bad thing...but, it something that is good to know. i love them and will definitely be wearing them very soon..."
5619	1	a	Ca not say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. do not pass this one up!
5620	1	a	I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt, which i had not counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still, the quality seemed to be good.
5621	1	a	I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected. the arm holes are a little large, meaning low. but other than that i love it.
5622	0	a	The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40.
5623	1	a	I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it a must have. now i want to get this in black!
5624	0	a	The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
5625	1	a	Very cute, and well made. fits true to size.
5626	1	a	Second to shopping for a swimsuit, i hate shopping for jeans. so difficult to find a pair that are both comfortable and stylish. the good news is that this pair is both. the length hits slightly below my ankle which is the perfect length for me (i'm 5'5). they are a slim fit with a slight bit of stretch. i ordered the size 27 which is my normal size and they fit perfectly. love the wash for a casual look. wish they also came in a darker wash for a dressier look. all in all, i am quite pleased. w
5627	1	a	Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!
5628	1	a	"Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6"" 127lb. not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!"
5629	1	a	It a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that close to skin color it not an issue, but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i'm very happy with this, though i'm also very very happy i got thi
5630	1	a	I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.
5631	1	a	I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing, i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length, not too short or long! going to order a second color, i have the plum and love it.
5632	1	a	These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are
5633	1	a	The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me.
5634	0	a	I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.
5635	1	a	I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.
5636	1	a	I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and does not seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.
5637	1	a	I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust
5638	1	a	I saw this sweater coat in store and thought it was gorgeous! i was turned off by the price so i waited for it to go on sale. luckily, i snatched it up right away. as other reviewers have stated, it is meant to be worn as a coat/jaclket and for me the medium ( i am usually a size 8 or medium in retailer) fit was slighly oversized on my 5'9 145lb frame. i admit that this not an item that i would usually have in my wardrobe and was not sure how the sweater and the fit looked on me. i was afraid it w
5639	1	a	The pattern is cute and vibrant, and the shillouette is simple, but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
5640	1	a	I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!
5641	1	a	These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel, perfect fit, great look, especially for dressing up and going out. love them.
5642	1	a	This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one
5643	0	a	You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i did not expect.
5644	0	a	The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable, i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.
5645	1	a	"I'm 5'7"", 125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador"
5646	1	a	This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms are not attached like a true poncho. it does not work for a petite customer, unfortunately, but on average sized it gorgeous. so pretty.
5647	0	a	I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
5648	0	a	Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,
5649	1	a	Runs big, but the fabric is nice and comfortable. i had to return first order and order the next size up. it is short in the front but a nice length in the back. it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique, more brownish orange than red. it will look great with boots!
5650	1	a	Beautiful sweater, very delicate fabric, unique design, but it runs very small. i usually wear a m, but ordered a large based on the previous review hoping that would do the trick. the sizing, along with being long waisted is not a good combination. unfortunately, i'm returning the sweater.
5651	1	a	I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.
5652	1	a	Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and is not baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and does not feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.
5653	1	a	"This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored, an xs looked better. i am 5'5"" 118 lbs, 34c, slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day."
5654	0	a	I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress. this was not it. completely see through. i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up. but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip. its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price. i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
5655	1	a	"This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3"" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!"
5656	1	a	"I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4"" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to"
5657	1	a	When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!
5658	1	a	This shirt is so great. it beautiful and functional. i received countless compliments the first time i wore it. i'm looking forward to wearing it again! worth the steep price, though it was hard to justify.
5659	1	a	This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.
5660	1	a	Love these jeans, fit and style... the wash is a makes them almost more navy blue than blue jean color... but they are soft and fit perfectly. another reviewer described them as mid rise, but they do not fit me that way at all
